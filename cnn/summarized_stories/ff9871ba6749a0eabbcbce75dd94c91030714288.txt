Uruguay hero Fernando Muslera was delighted after his team stunned hosts Argentina in a penalty shootout to reach the semifinals of the Copa America tournament, despite having a player sent off. The goalkeeper saved a spot-kick by striker Carlos Tevez to earn "La Celeste" a clash with Peru, who beat Colombia 2-0 after extra-time in Cordoba earlier on Saturday. The Uruguayans, who reached the last four at the 2010 World Cup, will be seeking to make the Copa final for the first time since 1999 when they line up in La Plata on Tuesday. I'm very happy for all the people in Uruguay. Then, penalties are just a matter of luck."
