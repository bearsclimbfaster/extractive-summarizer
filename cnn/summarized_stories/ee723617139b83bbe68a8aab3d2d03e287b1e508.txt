Pilot William Larson and his passenger were taking aerial photos from a single-engine plane for their Virginia photography company overnight when the plane had electrical problems, police say. Minutes later, the plane slammed into the living room of a third-story suburban Washington apartment in a crash that caused no life-threatening injuries, according to Virginia State Police. The Cessna crashed into the top floor of an apartment in Herndon as the residents slept Friday, shortly after midnight, seriously injuring Larson, 61, and hurting his passenger and a woman in the apartment, state police said.
