It is a momentous day for Georgian democracy -- but a painful one for the man who has led the former Soviet republic for nearly a decade. As the results became clear, President Mikheil Saakashvili, a larger-than-life figure who was swept to power in 2003, appeared on national television to accept defeat. After summing up the preliminary election results it is evident that the Georgian Dream coalition has achieved the advantage, he said, pledging not to hold up the process. But it must be a painful political blow to a man swept to power nine years ago in the popular Rose Revolution. Only now has there been comment from Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.
