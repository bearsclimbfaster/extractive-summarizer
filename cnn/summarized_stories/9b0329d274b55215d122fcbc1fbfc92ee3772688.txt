Oracle Team USA's improbable America's Cup comeback gathered further momentum on Monday after a fifth straight win over challengers Emirates Team New Zealand. Emirates Team New Zealand have been one win away from clinching the Auld Mug since last Wednesday, but Oracle Team USA never looked like losing Monday's race at San Francisco Bay. The New Zealanders still hold an 8-6 advantage over their American counterparts in the best-of-17 series.
