The United States is overhauling Bush-era plans for a missile defense shield in Europe, based partly on the latest analysis of Iran's offensive capabilities, President Obama said Thursday. The "new missile defense architecture in Europe ... will provide capabilities sooner, build on proven systems and offer greater defenses against the threat of missile attack than the... program" that former President George W. Bush proposed, Obama said. Obama said the change of gears was based on an "updated intelligence assessment" about Iran's ability to hit Europe with missiles. The Islamic republic's "short- and medium-range" missiles pose the most current threat, he said, and "this new ballistic missile defense will best address" that threat. "This new approach provides a better missile defense capability for our forces in Europe, for our European allies and eventually for our homeland than the program I recommended almost three years ago," said Gates, who was defense chief in the last two years of the Bush administration and stayed on when Obama took office.

American officials from Obama on down insisted Thursday's announcement does not reflect any lesser commitment to European defense. short-range and medium-range missiles," Fischer said. "I discussed this issue with the U.S. president during our meetings in London and Moscow. "Here Moscow isn't likely to be of much help to the White House. "This has nothing to do with Russia," he said. It's evolving into a different system."
