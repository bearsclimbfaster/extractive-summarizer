You know how good it feels when you fish a $10 bill out of your jeans pocket right before it hits the wash. Imagine coming into hundreds of dollars from a savings bond or a bank account you forgot about. But before you pay for this service, remember there are plenty of free Web sites that will help reunite you with your treasures. There's almost $33 billion in unclaimed money from old payroll checks, utility refunds, trust distributions, stocks, banking or checking accounts, certificates of deposit and the contents of safe deposit boxes, according to estimates by the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators. Property is considered abandoned if there has been no activity on it for more than three years, according to Steve Larson of NAUPA. To find your hidden money, go to http://www.missingmoney.com/, an official database for the NAUPA that has records from most state unclaimed property programs. For that, go to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's Web site at www.fdic.gov. Look under "Bank Find," and you'll be able to see the history of the bank, including any mergers. But if your bank failed, and you don't claim those funds within a year and a half, the money in your account is turned over to the FDIC.
