The 2010 Iditarod is officially under way, with 71 mushers and dog teams on the wide-open trail toward Nome. Teams will spend the next week and a half crossing 1,049 miles through some of the most demanding and formidable conditions on Earth, including North America's largest mountain chain, the Alaska range. "Ten days and nothing else but eat, sleep and feed dogs," Canadian musher Sebastian Schnuelle said excitedly. The sport has been dominated in recent years by Lance Mackey, 39, of Fairbanks, Alaska, and this year he will be trying to accomplish what no musher in history has been able to do: win four consecutive Iditarods. Mackey is a throat cancer survivor and is known for his fierce determination and competitive spirit. He has never won.
