Here are key initiatives from President Barack Obama's State of the Union address Tuesday night:

• Implementation of a minimum tax for multinational companies, which would fund additional tax breaks for companies that create jobs in or move them to the United States. • The creation of a China task force to monitor trade violations. Aggressive inspections to intercept "counterfeit or unsafe goods" from foreign countries. • Support for partnerships between companies and community colleges to train workers for new careers, all coordinated through a single government program. State laws that require students to stay in school until graduation or age 18. Lobby reform.
