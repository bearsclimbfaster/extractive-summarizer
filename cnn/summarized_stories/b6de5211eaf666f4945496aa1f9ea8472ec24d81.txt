It's that time of year again: You can't open a paper or click online without being subjected to April Foolery, from hard-to-swallow hoaxes to nearly-believable news. So did you spot the spoofs? They may be the biggest boyband in the world, but Britain's Daily Mirror says that won't help One Direction's plans to tour North Korea -- unless, that is, Harry Styles and co. are willing to swap their super-styled locks for Kim Jong-un's short-back-and-sides hairdo. Financial woes aren't normally a joking matter, but the UK's Sun newspaper reports that the Queen has found a novel solution to boost the monarchy's income: fracking in the grounds of Buckingham Palace. Other British papers see the upcoming vote on Scottish independence as ripe for giggles, with the Guardian revealing that, should Scots back a break with the rest of the United Kingdom later this year, the nation plans to show its solidarity with mainland Europe by switching to driving on the right.
