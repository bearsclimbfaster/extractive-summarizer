A number of themes emerge from the regional reports included in the National Climate Assessment -- things like risks to infrastructure due to rising oceans both benefits and harm to agricultural production because of changing temperature, and new realities for cooling and heating costs. NORTHWEST

If you live in the Northwest, you can appreciate how vital the snow accumulation in the mountains is. People's livelihoods, recreational areas and infrastructure could be affected by rising sea levels. White House: Climate change is here, action needed now

Examples from report:

-- "Since around 1950, area-averaged snowpack on April 1 in the Cascade Mountains decreased about 20%, spring snowmelt occurred 0 to 30 days earlier depending on location, late winter/early spring streamflow increases ranged from 0% to greater than 20% as a fraction of annual flow, and summer flow decreased 0% to 15% as a fraction of annual flow, with exceptions in smaller areas and shorter time periods." -- As sea levels rise, coastal areas of Washington and Oregon will flood more often. -- "Climate change will alter Northwest forests by increasing wildfire risk and insect and tree disease outbreaks, and by forcing longer-term shifts in forest types and species." -- Wildfires are a natural part of the forest ecosystem in the Northwest, but warmer and drier conditions have increased the number and extent of such fires. SOUTHWEST

Those in the Southwest, especially in California, have already seen what changes in sea levels and temperature can do. Examples from the report:

-- "Over the past 50 years across most of the Southwest, there has been less late-winter precipitation falling as snow, earlier snowmelt, and earlier arrival of most of the year's streamflow." -- Between 1970 and 2003, warmer and drier conditions increased the burned area in the western U.S. mid-elevation conifer forests by 650%. -- The sea level along the California coast has risen anywhere between 6.7 to 7.9 inches over the past 100 years. --"If adaptive action is not taken, coastal highways, bridges, and other transportation infrastructure (such as the San Francisco and Oakland airports) are at increased risk of flooding with a 16-inch rise in sea level in the next 50 years."
