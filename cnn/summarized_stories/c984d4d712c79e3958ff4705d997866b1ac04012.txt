A gun assault and a separate bombing have killed at least 40 people in two days in the city of Quetta in Pakistan. Militants sprayed bullets into cars near a mosque Friday in the capital of the province of Balochistan, killing 10 people on the Muslim holy day of Eid, police said. On Thursday, a suicide bombing tore through the funeral of a police official in Quetta, killing 30 people and wounding at least 40 others. In Friday's attack, a former provincial lawmaker was stepping into the mosque when about a dozen men opened fire, said police spokesman Mir Zubair Mehmood. The others were civilians.
