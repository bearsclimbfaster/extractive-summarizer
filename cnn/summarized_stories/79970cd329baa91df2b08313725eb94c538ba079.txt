Amid the rumblings of war between Russia and Ukraine, just how do you go about your everyday life? With foreboding and fear, according to former Ukraine football international Oleg Luzhny. "Everyone is scared about war -- they are very nervous," Luzhny, who enjoyed a successful spell in the English Premier League with Arsenal, told CNN. More than once during our interview, Luzhny seemed desperate to deliver this message: "It is important the whole world supports us." He was speaking from his mother's home in Kiev, Ukraine, on Monday, after flying there from London, where he lives with his wife and children. Luzhny, who was born in in the western city of Lviv, last held a managerial job with Tavriya Simferopol -- a club based in Crimea, an autonomous region of eastern Ukraine with strong loyalty to Russia. They are very nervous. Ukraine has been in chaos since President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted on February 22 following bloody street protests which left many dead and hundreds injured. A deepening split within Ukraine society has seen those in the western part of the country supporting the interim government and ties with the European Union, while those in the east advocate a Russian presence in Ukraine.
