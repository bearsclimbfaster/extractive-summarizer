For author Charles Yu, "When it happens, this is what happens: I shoot myself. "Not, you know, my self self. He steps out of a time machine, introduces himself as Charles Yu. I kill him. This is the dilemma posed in Charles Yu's debut novel, "How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe." Yu's genre-defying story of time travel is receiving critical praise for being a quirky mix of string theory, "A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" and Philip Roth. Yu's appearance at this summer's San Diego Comic-Con won him a slew of new fans and generated buzz for the book. "How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe" features a down-on-his-luck time machine repairman, living in Minor Universe 31. It's an alternate reality similar to our own. He's got a crush on his computer operating system, named Tammy, and has the great misfortune of getting stuck in a time loop. CNN recently asked Yu about his book and this often-debated science fiction "what-if?" CNN: So this is not your typical time travel story. Yu: I've always thought of a novel, just the idea of what a novel is, as an amazing technology. So it really started with the time machine itself, the TM-31 Recreational Time Travel Device, and the guy inside of it, a time travel technician. The time machine is a small, shower-sized box inside of a bigger box, Minor Universe 31. In writing "How to Live Safely," I tried to create some of the same feel, of this environment, this minor universe where the main character felt constrained in some ways, yet unnervingly free in other ways, as if he realized he was trapped in a story, and yet at the same time he was creating the story through his choices.
