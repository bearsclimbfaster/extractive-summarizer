Saadiyat Island, a $22 billion cultural project, will include local branches of New York University, as well as the Louvre and Guggenheim Museums. "Now, finally, Emirati developers and their international partners have stepped up to the plate on Saadiyat Island to start to protect workers, but they will need to do more to curtail the abuses." HRW first reported on the subject in 2009, when they found widespread exploitation of laborers on Saadiyat Island. The report also found contractors are "regularly confiscating worker passports and substituting worker contracts with less favorable ones when the workers arrive in the UAE." TDIC therefore firmly believes that this report is not an accurate reflection of the current situation on Saadiyat."
