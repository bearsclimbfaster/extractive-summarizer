The deaths of 26 victims in the latest wave of violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo might constitute war crimes, a United Nations spokesman said Saturday. A Congolese girl cries as she walks with her mother near Kibati on Friday. It is unclear who was responsible for the deaths in the village of Kiwanja or how many of the victims were civilians. But if some of the victims are found to be non-combatants, their deaths could be handled by a war crimes tribunal, said Madnodje Mounoubai, U.N. mission spokesman in Kinshasa. Mounoubai made the remarks one day after leaders at a regional summit called for an immediate cease-fire and the creation of humanitarian corridors in areas plagued by bloody attacks. Despite a unilateral cease-fire declared by Nkunda last week, fighting has continued, and there are reports of heavy civilian casualties in recent days. There are 17,000 U.N. peacekeepers in Congo, the largest U.N. peacekeeping force in the world, but U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the forces have been "stretched to the limit." Nkunda was not present at the summit. Rwanda denies that.
