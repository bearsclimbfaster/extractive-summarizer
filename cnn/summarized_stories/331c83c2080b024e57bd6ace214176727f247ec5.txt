The opposition group said the bomber was from the al-Nusra Front, which has claimed responsibility for past suicide attacks. CNN cannot independently confirm government or opposition reports out of Syria, as the government has restricted access by journalists. This figure includes 72 dead in Idlib province, among them 32 "martyred (in a) massacre in Kafr Nabl." Eight women, seven children and two citizen journalists were among the casualties, the LCC said. Samer Kreishi was killed in fighting in the Damascus suburb of Arbeen, where government forces and rebels have been fighting sporadically for months, the LCC said. No one was injured by the gunfire, and Israeli officials do not believe its vehicles were targeted, the spokesman said. But the bullets are believed to be related to Syria's ongoing civil war. Israel's military filed a complaint about the incident with the United Nations, according to the military spokesman. The tanks were positioned with their guns pointing toward Syria and fired, Israel said.
