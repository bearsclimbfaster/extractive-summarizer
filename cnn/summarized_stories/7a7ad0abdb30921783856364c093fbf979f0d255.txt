Johnson was catapulted into the exclusive fraternity of White House families and embraced what she describes as a role she landed simply by chance.

Johnson speaks fondly of the opportunity she was afforded to dine with kings and queens, meet the movers and shakers of her time, engage with the body of America and hold a front-row seat to history.
