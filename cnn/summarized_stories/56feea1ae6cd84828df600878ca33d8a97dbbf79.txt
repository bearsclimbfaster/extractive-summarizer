Hours after talking at length with U.S. and Russian authorities, the father of the two suspects in last week's deadly Boston Marathon attack is set to fly to the United States -- and cooperate with authorities -- an activist working with the family told CNN. Anzor Tsarnaev told Russia's state-run RIA Novosti that he and his wife, Zubeidat, will leave the semi-autonomous southern Russian republic of Dagestan on Thursday. Authorities from various U.S. government agencies did not immediately confirm the Tsarnaevs' travel plans. According to the official Russian news report, a police source said Wednesday that the suspects' parents consented to their U.S. trip and "will be involved in the U.S. investigation." After that report came out, human rights activist Kheda Saratova told CNN that only the father, Anzor, would travel to the United States as early as Friday. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died days later following an early morning shootout with police. His body remained unclaimed Wednesday, according to Terrel Harris, a spokesman for Massachusetts' chief medical examiner's office. His brother Dzhokhar was captured the next night after being found hidden inside a boat in the backyard of a Watertown, Massachusetts, home. Characterized in fair condition at a Boston hospital, the 19-year-old suspect has been communicating with authorities. So, too, have his parents. On Wednesday, FBI agents were in Makhachkala, Dagestan -- a city that Tamerlan called home for several months in 2012 -- to talk with the suspects' parents.
