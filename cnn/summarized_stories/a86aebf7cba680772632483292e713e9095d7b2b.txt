Developers at Bioware are hoping to catch that same virtual lightning in a bottle with "Ultima Forever: Quest for the Avatar," the next chapter in the search for the Avatar of Britannia. In it, the hero must achieve the highest levels in eight virtues: Valor, Justice, Honor, Compassion, Honestly, Humility, Sacrifice and Spirituality. The new title is based off "Ultima IV," a computer game dating all the way to 1985. Lead designer Kate Flack said "Ultima Forever" hopes to bring back the appeal of being a good person in a video game. They are affected by all the things around them," Flack said. The developers of "Ultima IV" "were saying games can be about being a good person. I'm going to be as subversive as 'Ultima IV' was at the time." "Ultima Forever" picks up 21 years after "Ultima IV" left off. While the graphics, look and feel have obviously been upgraded due to advancements in technology over the years, Flack said the concept still remains true to what it was nearly three decades ago. "When (a non-player character) asks you a question ... you are forced to pause and ask yourself, 'What do I think is the right thing to do? What kind of person am I?' "

Rather than seeing how many creatures a player can kill or how much gold they can accumulate, Flack is more interested in getting inside the player's head.
