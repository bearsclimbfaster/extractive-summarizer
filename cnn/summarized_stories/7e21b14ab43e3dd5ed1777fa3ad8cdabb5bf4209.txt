Sir Robert Edwards, a "co-pioneer" of the in vitro fertilization technique and Nobel Prize winner, died Wednesday in his sleep after a long illness, the University of Cambridge said. He was 87. Edwards, a professor at the university and fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge, and Dr. Patrick Steptoe developed the fertility treatment, which involves fertilizing an egg outside the womb and implanting the newly created embryo inside a woman's uterus.
