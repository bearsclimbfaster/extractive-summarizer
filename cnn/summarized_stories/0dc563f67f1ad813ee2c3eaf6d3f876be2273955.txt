First, the good news: Ebola is in decline. That there are just a handful of cases left now in Liberia is an incredible feat, but it has come at an equally incredible cost. And Ebola is still critically dangerous. Hotspots remain. Sierra Leone has 65 confirmed cases, most in the west of the country around the capital and Port Loco where the disease spreads through overcrowded slums. The World Health Organisation (WHO) said last week that only half the cases in Liberia and Guinea came from known Ebola contacts, which suggests that hidden cases are causing outbreaks. "A single new case is enough to reignite an outbreak," says Brice de la Vigne, director of operations at Medecins sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders). "Until everyone who has come into contact with Ebola is identified, we cannot rest easy." Oxfam is calling for "a massive post-Ebola Marshall Plan," saying the world "cannot dither on recovery as it dithered over Ebola." Their plea comes as the WHO and other agencies engage in intense soul-searching: What went wrong? Admitting to organizational shortcomings Margaret Chan, the WHO's Director General, has asked the world's wealthier nations to step up to the plate and support poor countries' fragile health care systems.
