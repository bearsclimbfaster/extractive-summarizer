The prospect of a Palestinian state is nil so long as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stays in office, Netanyahu said in a Monday interview. Asked by an interviewer with the Israeli news site, NRG, if it was true that a Palestinian nation would never be formed while he's prime minister, Netanyahu replied, "Indeed." His interview with NRG came as he courted conservative supporters a day before Israelis head to the polls for national elections. "Anyone who is going to establish a Palestinian state, anyone who is going to evacuate territories today, is simply giving a base for attacks to the radical Islam against Israel," he said. Netanyahu went on to say that any opponents on the left who might argue otherwise are "sticking their head in the sand, time and time again." "I do not give in," Netanyahu told NRG.
