Three days after Asiana Airlines Flight 214 crash landed at San Francisco International Airport with the loss of two lives, there is still no official explanation for what caused the incident. Officials have said the Boeing 777, which had flown from Seoul in South Korea, was traveling slower than recommended on its final approach, though it could be months before a definite cause for this is determined. CNN looks at how such an investigation works. Interactive: What happened with Asiana Flight 214? Who's in charge of the investigation? In the United States, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is the government agency that investigates all major aviation accidents. Since it was formed in 1967, the NTSB has completed more than 132,000 aviation accident investigations, with most taking weeks or even months to complete. Did passengers ignore safety messages? What happens after a crash? In the first hours after a major accident occurs, the NTSB deploys a "go-team" of technical experts, who are on call 24/7 with their bags packed. "Once they arrive, it's like police arriving on a crime scene," explained Tom Ballantyne, a journalist and aviation expert. Because of the large amount of evidence, the NTSB never speculates prematurely.
