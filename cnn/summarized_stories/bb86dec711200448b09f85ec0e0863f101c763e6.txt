Samsung on Monday announced a "premiere" event set for next month in London, along with a set of cryptic images suggesting new devices for its Galaxy and Windows-based lines. The event is set for Thursday, June 20, at the Earls Court exhibition center in London. The announcement specifically mentions the Korean electronics maker's Galaxy and ATIV lines. Galaxy is the company's trademark line of Android-based mobile products -- chief among them the Galaxy S4 smartphone, which has emerged as the chief rival to Apple's iPhone.
