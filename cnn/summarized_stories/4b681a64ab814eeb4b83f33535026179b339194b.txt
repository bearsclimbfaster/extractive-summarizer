An Arlington, Texas, police officer was among three people killed in a shooting at an apartment complex Tuesday night, officials said. It was at least the second fatal shooting in two days of a law enforcement officer in the United States. On Monday, a Georgia state trooper was fatally shot after a traffic stop in northwest Atlanta. In the Arlington incident, the officer had been dispatched to an apartment complex to check out a report of domestic assault, city spokeswoman Tiara Richard told reporters.
