NASA has postponed for one day the scheduled launch of a rocket carrying a solar probe. The space agency plans to launch an Atlas V rocket carrying its Solar Dynamics Observatory, which it says will study the sun "in greater detail than ever before." After delaying the launch three times because of windy conditions Wednesday at Cape Canaveral, Florida, NASA said it will try again Thursday, with a launch window of 10:23 a.m. to 11:23 a.m. ET. "The vehicle's flight control system sensed wind loads exceeding the limit, prompting the abrupt end to the countdown," NASA said. The agency says the observatory will provide a better understanding of the sun and its role in space weather events such as solar flares, which can wreak havoc on Earth. The five-year mission "will determine how the sun's magnetic field is generated, structured and converted into violent solar events like turbulent solar wind, solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections," according to the agency. In addition, changes in magnetic energy such as those around sunspots can change Global Positioning System signals, making them less accurate

"If you're landing a great big jet airliner in a low-visibility situation and you have one of these events that causes a misinterpretation of location by 150 to 200 yards, that's big stuff when you're trying to hit a runway with these instruments," Fisher said.
