After Tuesday's unveiling of two new iPhones and a heavily anticipated smartwatch, Apple gave press and special guests (including models, fashion bloggers and Gwen Stefani) some supervised hands-on time with the gadgets. Here are our first impressions of the Apple Watch. This watch is still under construction

It appears Apple is still ironing out the details of its new smartwatch, which is scheduled to be available early next year. In the large white showroom Apple custom built for the event, rows of iPhone 6s and Apple Watches were on display. Apple employees put them on people's wrists and removed them. It fits! Full disclosure: I have dainty wrists. Apple has always focused heavily on the design of its products, and that legacy really shows with the Apple Watch. At a glance, there is a chance someone might mistake an Apple Watch for a regular timepiece. To communicate from your wrist, you dictate messages to the watch or use it as a walkie-talkie to chat with another Apple Watch wearer. Apple is really hoping people will choose to communicate using what it calls Digital Touch, a combination of drawings and vibrations.
