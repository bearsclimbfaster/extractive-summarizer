Can crowdfunding help an iconic team return to the Formula One grid after a 20-year hiatus? That's the aim for the family of the late three-time world champion Sir Jack Brabham, whose eponymous team still roars with resonance through motorsport history. In 1966, the Australian conjured a unique feat in F1 history when, at the age of 40, he became the only man to win the driver and team world titles with a car of his own make. All in all, the Brabham team engineered two constructor titles and four driver crowns -- with Brabham in 1967, Denny Hulme in 1968 and Nelson Piquet in 1981 and 1983 -- and was owned by F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone for much of the 1970s and 1980s. Inspired by Sir Jack's ingenuity and get-up-and-go attitude, his family have now launched Project Brabham. "Brabham sits alongside Ferrari, McLaren and Lotus because of what dad achieved," David Brabham, Sir Jack's youngest son, tells CNN. "If you look at the history and heritage and what it means to people, a Brabham should really be out there -- racing is in our DNA." Project Brabham is relying on this affection for the Brabham brand as it seeks to raise an initial $400,000 through crowdfunding. Donations start at just $1.60 and climb to $16,000 for a VIP experience, which includes a one-on-one on-track driving lesson from former F1 racer David. asks Brabham.
