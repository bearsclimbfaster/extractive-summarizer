Southern California police on Friday closed their investigation into Hollywood publicist Ronnie Chasen's shooting death late last year, concluding that an ex-convict murdered her in a random, botched robbery. The suspect, 43-year-old Harold Martin Smith, pulled a handgun and shot himself last December as Beverly Hills detectives approached him at Hollywood's Harvey Apartments. But despite evidence even then tying Smith to Chasen's murder last November, authorities kept the case open. Beverly Hills police Lt. Tony Lee told CNN early this year that "we hope to close it soon."
