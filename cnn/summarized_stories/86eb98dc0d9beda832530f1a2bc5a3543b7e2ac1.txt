Changes to tires will make Formula 1 racing faster with more overtaking in 2013, according to the sport's official tire supplier Pirelli. Unveiled at the Italian company's headquarters in Milan on Thursday, the new look tires include softer compounds and new constructions which could lower lap times by up to 0.5 seconds, the company says.
