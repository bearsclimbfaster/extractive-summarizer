Asia's affluent middle classes have long been eager to enroll their kids in the West's elite schools but now they no longer need to travel as far to do so. Some of the most notable names in British and North American education are establishing campuses across Asia as they seek to tap into the region's multi-billion dollar international school market. On Monday, Winston Churchill's alma mater, Harrow, opened its doors to 750 students in Hong Kong. The 500-year old British fee-paying school already has outposts in Bangkok and Beijing. Other prominent schools targeting Asia include Wellington College and Dulwich College in China, Branksome Hall in and Dwight School in South Korea, Epsom College in Malaysia, and Haileybury in Kazakhstan.
