Uruguay's controversial World Cup star Luis Suarez has been given a seven-match suspension after being found guilty of biting an opposition player in a Dutch league match. The striker will miss six Eredivisie games as well as a Dutch Cup tie, ruling him out until his club Ajax's next league match at home to De Graafschap on February 4. The Amsterdam side's captain was punished by the Royal Netherlands Football Association following an incident in Sunday's 0-0 draw with PSV Eindhoven. The 23-year-old -- who was infamously sent off during the World Cup quarterfinal against Ghana in July after saving a goal-bound attempt with his hands -- was investigated after biting PSV player Otman Bakkal.
