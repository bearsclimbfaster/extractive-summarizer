Michael Jackson was "totally addicted to propofol," the surgical anesthetic the coroner ruled killed him, the pop star's dermatologist said in an interview with the In Session network. Dr. Arnold Klein said he personally tried several times to prevent other doctors from administering propofol to Jackson for sleep. "I knew this problem existed," Klein said in the interview Saturday. Whenever I could, I prevented it, but I'm only one man and I have to support my own life and take care of myself." Klein disputed the argument by Dr. Conrad Murray's lawyers that he addicted Jackson to Demerol in the months before his death, saying he used only low doses of the painkiller while repairing Jackson's collapsed nose and jawline. Because Demerol was not found in Jackson's blood, the judge did not allow Dr. Murray's defense to call Klein as a witness in Murray's involuntary manslaughter trial, in which jurors are scheduled to resume deliberations Monday morning. Klein described three instances in which he said he was involved as interventions to prevent Jackson from getting propofol, although Klein gave no indication of when the incidents occurred. Klein, interviewed in his Beverly Hills home, said that while it was too upsetting to watch much of the trial, he watched enough to believe Murray wanted to "make me look like a demon" and "make me as a scapegoat."
