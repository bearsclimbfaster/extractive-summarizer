For the last 20 years, what name is always in the top 100 most popular baby names given to boys in the United States? Jesus (pronounced hey-seus). And among 4,500 boys names in England in 2009, what was the No. In Brussels? Oslo? Amsterdam? Everything. Let's do Demography 101, which is basically the study of baby-making. Who will pay Social Security to support grandpa? Who do you think will start the next Facebook, Amazon or Google? That's not good. Simple: immigration. Hispanic babies, 83 million of them, will account for 65% of that growth.Â  This is where the total fertility rate comes into play again, 2.84 for Hispanics, but only 1.84 and trending much lower for non-Hispanic whites who will only add  4 million babies to the melting pot. Keep in mind that those Hispanic babies born here to Mitt Romney's "self-deportation" candidates are all red-blooded American citizens -- our future Navy SEALs, entrepreneurs, middle-class working Americans and maybe even a president. U.S. politicians voted Thursday to possibly saddle our grandkids with $16.4 trillion in debt, but European politicians trying to fix their debt quagmire don't have grandkids to stick it to.
