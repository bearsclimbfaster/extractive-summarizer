You shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket, but Iowa Republicans are willing to put a few into a neighborhood dispute involving chickens and Democratic Senate candidate Bruce Braley's yard. It should be something that went no further than a community newsletter, but one of the neighbors is Braley, a U.S. congressman who grew up and owns a home in the Holiday Lake neighborhood. The others are Pauline Hampton and her four chickens, which run freely into both backyards, sometimes leaving evidence of their cross-property line roaming. With primary over, Iowa Senate race gets ugly

It's that evidence -- chicken stuff -- that made Braley and his wife cry fowl. "I had offered them to her and she says, 'I can't accept them because I've filed a formal complaint against you.' Braley may be right.
