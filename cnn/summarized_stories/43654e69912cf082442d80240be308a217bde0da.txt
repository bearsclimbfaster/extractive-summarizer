Like many voters on Election Day, Nurul Aman and his family dutifully rose before sunrise and headed to the polls in Andover, Massachusetts, to cast their votes. Nurul, Nilufur and Samuel Aman voted as a family for Barack Obama in their first presidential election this year. But this election was especially significant for Aman, wife Nilufur and son Samuel, who were all voting for the first time. "As the first-time voter, it was emotionally remarkable to perform my civic duty," said Aman, a Bangladeshi native who became a U.S. citizen in 2005. Samuel Aman is a college student, and his parents, both in their 50s, are recent citizens. An overwhelming majority of first-time voters, including the Amans, voted for Sen. Barack Obama over Sen. John McCain by a margin of 69 to 31 percent, CNN exit polls show. For Aman, a business and economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, it was an easy choice. That is the only way economy can get back on track," Aman said. That's what kind of sparked my interest.
