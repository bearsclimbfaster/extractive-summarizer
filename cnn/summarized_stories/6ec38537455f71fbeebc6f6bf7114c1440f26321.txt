CNN asked readers to share their experiences with sexual harassment on the street in the comments section of a recent article titled 'Hey baby! Women speak out against street harassment.' A few themes stood out: Who's to blame? Are women complicit in street harassment? Commenter Frank Montgomery saw the issue of street harassment as cultural: "Instead of blaming men, I would suggest that our larger culture might be more responsible for this. Ladies, consider yourself fortunate that many such comments are camouflaged in sexual context. Violence, manipulation, deceit and controlling behaviors are often their modus operandi. Also, remember women are not exempt from these trait, they are just manifest different." Lovehope agreed: "Much of rap music encourages this behavior.

Guest98989: "It's also interesting to see that some guy can literally be a stalker but it's cool if the girl is into him but then you can have some poor, somewhat less attractive guy simply say hello to a girl, get viciously rejected and then hear the girls talking trash about the creepy freak stalker who dared to say hello to one of them (despite the fact that the poor dude never bothered them before or again). Don't lie to us. Get it? COWARDS! Life is short." Get over it. Woman up.
