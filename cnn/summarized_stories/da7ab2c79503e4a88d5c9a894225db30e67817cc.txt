Dear Mr. Lucas,

I was sincerely disturbed when I found out you where planning on converting the "Star Wars" franchise to 3-D. This is one of the worst ideas you've ever had about "Star Wars." And let's face it -- you've had some real stinkers: "The Star Wars Holiday Special" ring a bell? I want to believe that you think this is a good move for the franchise but please consider what 3-D will do to the "Star Wars" legacy. As a wise man once said, "This is a dangerous time for you when you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force." Thank you for all the years of enjoyment you have given me. When I sat in the theater in Petersburg, Virginia, in 1977 and saw "Star Wars" (I refuse to call it "A New Hope") I walked away with a vision of not only how good can triumph over evil but how seeing a movie could be the coolest thing to ever happen to me.
