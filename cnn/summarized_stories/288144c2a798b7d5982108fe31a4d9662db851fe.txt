By rights Depp -- who already played Thompson's alter-ego Raoul Duke in Terry Gilliam's grandly grotesque "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" -- should be too old to play the latest recruit on a failing American newspaper in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

When Kemp washes up in San Juan, his greatest literary achievement is his resume. He's promptly put on the astrology desk.
