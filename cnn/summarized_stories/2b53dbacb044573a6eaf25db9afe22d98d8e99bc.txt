Anti-Semitic incidents worldwide dropped sharply in 2010 from their peak in 2009, according to an annual report issued by an Israeli university on the eve of the nation's Holocaust Memorial Day. However, the levels are significantly higher than they were a decade ago, when the upward trend began, according to the report from Tel Aviv University's Steven Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Anti-Semitism and Racism and the Kantor Center for the Study of European Jewry. "The important question that must be asked today is: Have we learned the lessons of the Holocaust in the world? The hatred of Jews and the denial of their existence have turned into hatred of the Jewish state and denial of its existence."
