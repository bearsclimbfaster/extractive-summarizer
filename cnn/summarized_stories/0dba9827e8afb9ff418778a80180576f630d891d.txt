It's small, affluent, tech-savvy and it has a very obvious pollution problem -- Hong Kong is arguably an ideal destination for electric cars. MyCar, the electric vehicle developed in Hong Kong, would be perfect for the city, but faces big obstacles. MyCar, a two-seater micro car, will roll of the production line for the very first time in October and will be available for purchase. But you won't find it on sale in Hong Kong. Hong Kong still hasn't got its act together when it comes to electric vehicles (EVs), according to the chief executive of MyCar's manufacturer, EuAuto Technology, Chung Sin-ling. She says the city lacks the necessary framework and policies that would make it viable for her company to sell MyCar here. So they are heading to Europe instead. "In London they have government incentives to get people to switch from gasoline to electric vehicles," explains Chung, citing the waiver of the congestion charge and free parking for EVs in London as an example. "[Hong Kong Electric] only use them inside their private site and they have to get a very special licence and they can't drive outside their site and they are restricted to certain uses," she says. It was about $130,000 for MyCar. It's nonsense.
