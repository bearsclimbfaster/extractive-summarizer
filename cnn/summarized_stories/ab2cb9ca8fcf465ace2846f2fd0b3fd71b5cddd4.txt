Ruta Meilutyte's initial brush with swimming as a seven-year-old in Lithuania could never have foretold her success in the pool. "I remember in my first session I jumped into the deep end and nearly drowned," Meilutyte told CNN's Human to Hero series. Only eight years after that frightening experience, Meilutyte became her country's maiden Olympic gold medalist in swimming by upsetting the reigning world champion in the 100-meter breaststroke at London 2012. However, her path to success and "rock star" status in Lithuania, as her coach put it, hasn't been an easy one. Still not officially classified as an adult, she has had to deal with the death of her mother, who was hit by a car when Meilutyte was four and barely out of diapers. She was also forced to adapt to a new country when she left Lithuania for England in 2009, a life-altering move instigated by her father who thought his daughter's prospects in both swimming and academics would improve. He was right. Meilutyte trains in Plymouth, southwest England, and goes to the same school attended by Tom Daley, a bronze medalist in diving for Great Britain in 2012. Her coach Jon Rudd calls her a "great scholar." In Lithuania, the pool is "not great," Meilutyte said. "We just decided to go to England because it would be a great time to balance school and swimming at the same time as college. Yes Lithuania and England are really a bit different, the people are different, but I got used to it really fast." In a sport where half a second is a sizable progression, Meilutyte shaved about two seconds off her personal best in London, raising her level when it mattered most. Rudd said a breakout performance from Meilutyte had been "brewing for a while" and that there was nothing sinister behind her incredible improvement -- Chinese teen Ye Shiwen had to rebut accusations of possible drug use after her own world-record performances at London 2012.
