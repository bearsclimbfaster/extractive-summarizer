William Kamkwamba dreamed of powering his village with the only resource that was freely available to him. William Kamkwamba fits a lightbulb to a house in his village in Malawi. His native Malawi had gone through one of its worst droughts seven years ago, killing thousands. The red soil in his Masitala hometown was parched, leaving his father, a farmer, without any income. Wind. Kamkwamba was kicked out of school when he couldn't pay $80 in school fees, and he spent his days at the library, where a book with photographs of windmills caught his eye. That was 2002. The windmills generate electricity and pump water in his hometown, north of the capital, Lilongwe. Others stop by to listen to Malawian reggae music blaring from a radio.
