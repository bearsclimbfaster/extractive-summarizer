Whenever anything involves the "Star Wars" franchise, there are certain expectations that need to be met to satisfy die-hard, and even casual, fans. So when a new video game wants to bring "Star Wars" to life like never before, that's setting the bar really high. "Kinect Star Wars" tries to use the power of the Kinect controller for the Xbox 360 to put players into the action, using full-body motions to wield lightsabers, drive podracers and, unfortunately, dance for Jabba the Hutt. The game has a few high points but also has more disappointments than a bad motivator on a defective R2 unit. One section, Duels of Fate, is locked at the very beginning, but quickly unlocks after players complete the first mission in the Jedi Destiny section. When the Kinect controller works, the actions are seamless and fluid. Rancor Rampage was probably the most fun out of all the segments. Players act as a freed rancor (Remember him? The monster in the pit at Jabba's lair?)
