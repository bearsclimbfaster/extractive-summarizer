Two New York residents have been arrested on charges of conspiring to send aid to terrorist groups in Afghanistan, New York City officials said Thursday. Humayoun Ghoulan Nabi, 27, and Ismail Alsarabbi, 32, are charged with conspiring to solicit aid in support of terrorist organizations -- including the Taliban and al Qaeda -- fighting American troops in Afghanistan. Nabi, a Pakistani national, and Alsarabbi, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Kuwait, allegedly planned to supply warm winter clothing and electronics to militants in the region to ensure their attacks can continue during harsh Afghan winters, according to the Queens County District Attorney's office.
