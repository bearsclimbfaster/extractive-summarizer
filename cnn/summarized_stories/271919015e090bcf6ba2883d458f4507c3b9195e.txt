The fiancee of Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber lived on property that was to be used for growing marijuana, and married an illegal immigrant for money during a period in her life when she was "associating with the wrong kind of people and making mistakes," according to a statement she released Tuesday. Cylvia Hayes, 47, admitted to living on a property in Okanogan, Oregon, in 1997 that was supposed to become a marijuana growing operation, but she said it never materialized. "I am not proud of that brief period of time - I was involved in an abusive relationship with a dangerous man," Hayes said. The man who sold the property to Hayes and her boyfriend told CNN affiliate KOIN that the couple stopped making payments.
