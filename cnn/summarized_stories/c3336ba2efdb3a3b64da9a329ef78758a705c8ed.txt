Al Jazeera will not broadcast video it received showing killings in France blamed on Mohammed Merah, it announced Tuesday, saying the material "does not meet our Code of Ethics." The network is "also declining all requests for copies," it said on Twitter. The decision came after Al Jazeera's Paris bureau chief said the network received video of the shootings in the mail. The edited footage contains images of the killings of seven people, along with music, religious singing and readings from the Quran, bureau chief Zied Tarrouche said Tuesday. "You can hear the gunshots at the time of the killings. ... You can hear the cries of the victims," he said on CNN affiliate BFM-TV. Al Jazeera gave the material to the police, he said.
