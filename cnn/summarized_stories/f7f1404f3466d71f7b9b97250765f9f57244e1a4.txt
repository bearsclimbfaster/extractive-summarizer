Fierce clashes followed suicide bombings and checkpoint attacks Sunday in Yemen, leaving dozens dead as the government fought back in a province largely controlled by terrorist groups, officials said. At least five troops were killed when suicide bombers earlier attacked two military posts in Abyan, where the government has been desperately trying to weaken terrorist groups after they took over large parts of the province last year. The bombers used explosives-laden vehicles to hit posts on the outskirts of Zinjibar and in the town of Dofas, the officials said. Residents said heavy clashes with militants erupted Saturday night in all three locations. CNN's Jamie Crawford contributed to this report.
