In the center of it all was Julie Trotter -- moaning through hard labor contractions. Doula Kai Martin Short works to ease Julie Trotter's pain during labor. For more than six hours, Trotter, a 23-year-old from Duluth, Georgia, tried different techniques to ease the pain of natural childbirth. Not only was her husband offering encouragement, but so was her doula, Kai Martin Short. "She definitely was a lifesaver for sure," Trotter says. Doula is a Greek word meaning "woman's servant." "Doulas trust birth and are not afraid of it even when the mom and dad get afraid," Short said. For a flat fee of $700 per client, she meets with the parents before the baby's due date to talk about their expectations and to share techniques to be used during labor.
