The Central Americans crossing the U.S. border in massive waves have been described as immigrants or refugees. The distinction is significant and could determine whether the migrants are subject to deportation to their home country or eligible to remain in the United States under asylum. The United States has a legal process for that immigrant to seek legal residency and eventually citizenship. As such, they are subject to "removal" or deportation from the United States. There are 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States -- a problem that has led Democrats and Republicans alike to declare the U.S. immigration system as "broken." "Migrants, especially economic migrants, choose to move in order to improve the future prospects of themselves and their families," the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees says.
