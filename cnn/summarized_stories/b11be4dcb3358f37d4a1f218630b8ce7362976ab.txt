"We just kept praying, and we kept hope alive," rescued boater Tressel Hawkins told CNN on Monday. Hawkins, 43, and his fellow boaters, Curtis Hall, 28, and James Phillips, 30, set out on August 21 from Matagorda Bay in Texas and went about 100 miles south. Their first night in the Gulf of Mexico almost proved fatal. While Hawkins was sleeping, he said, he felt the bean bag he was resting on floating. The water extractor had malfunctioned.

As Hall had the radio in his hand to call for help, the boat capsized, Phillips told CNN affiliate KHOU-TV. They were "shocked," Phillips said.
