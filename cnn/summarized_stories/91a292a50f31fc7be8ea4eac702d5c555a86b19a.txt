The Democratic candidate for governor of Massachusetts just got some more bad news. Attorney General Martha Coakley became the first Democratic governor candidate in 20 years to not receive the endorsement of the Boston Globe in the general election, with the publication instead endorsing Republican Charlie Baker on Sunday. CNN's Steve Brusk contributed to this report.
