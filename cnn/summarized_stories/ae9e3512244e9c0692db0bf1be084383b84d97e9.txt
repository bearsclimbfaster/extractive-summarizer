While the country's been debating Woody Allen and Dylan Farrow, I've been thinking about Alaska, where a staggering 59% of women are subjected to sexual or intimate partner violence, including threats of violence, in their lives. Farrow expanded recently on the allegation that Allen, maker of the films "Manhattan" and "Annie Hall," sexually assaulted her as a young girl. She stared at a toy train set while it happened, she wrote in a blog post for the New York Times. Allen denies the allegations. Related: The rapist next door

Progress has been made to reduce rape rates nationwide, but Alaska still has the highest reported rape rate in the country, according to 2012 FBI crime estimates.
