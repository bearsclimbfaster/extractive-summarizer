Champion skier or female fighter pilot? Whether to hurtle down the slopes at breakneck speed or defy G-force in the cockpit of a jet plane. The need for speed is the common theme, but it was an unusual and certainly unique career choice that faced Switzerland's Olympic downhill gold medalist Dominique Gisin. Even as an up and coming star on the junior circuit, Gisin was plagued by persistent knee injuries and fearing for her future in the sport, turned to her second passion, flying, to make a living. Showing the sort of determination that was to see her reach the heights of the sporting world, Gisin may well have become the first woman to pilot fighter jets for the country's air force. Fate then played its part and, ironically as a result of her skiing injuries, the officers in charge of the flying program decided Gisin's fragile knees would not stand the rigors of full-time military service. "But I never regretted. The choice of skiing looked to be validated by her first World Cup podium in early 2007, but Gisin's injury problems continued and after a fall in downhill training she was sidelined yet again through a knee problem.
