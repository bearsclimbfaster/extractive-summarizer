Los Alamos National Laboratory announced Wednesday it is notifying nearly 2,000 current and former employees and visitors that they may have been exposed to beryllium in the lab and may be at risk of disease. Officials are trying to determine the source of beryllium found at Los Alamos National Laboratory. "Letters went out to all of them today," said Kevin Roark, a spokesman for the New Mexico laboratory.
