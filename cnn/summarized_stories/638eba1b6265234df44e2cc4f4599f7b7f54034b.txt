A letter of reprimand was sent to the 911 operator who handled the emergency call from a social worker seeking help as Josh Powell killed his sons and himself in his Graham, Washington, home in February. It took eight minutes for 911 communications officer David Lovrak to send a police car, and it took an additional 13 minutes for a police car to get to Powell's home, according to the letter released Thursday. Lovrak violated several department policies and failed to recognize "many red flags" that should have led to a faster response, the reprimand said. "You further stated that you wished you had known who Josh Powell was."
