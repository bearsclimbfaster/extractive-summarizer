The International Cricket Council said Saturday it has launched an investigation into claims of a new betting scandal involving the Pakistan national team. The allegations, which emerged Saturday in the British tabloid The Sun, relate to the third One-Day International between England and Pakistan, held in London on Friday. "A source informed The Sun newspaper that a certain scoring pattern would emerge during certain stages of the match and, broadly speaking, that information appeared to be correct," ICC Chief Executive Haroon Lorgat said in a statement.
