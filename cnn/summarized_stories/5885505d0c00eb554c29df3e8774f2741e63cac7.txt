For me, Chinese New Year used to be fun. When I was a kid, I was excited during Chinese New Year when I got lai see and I could stay up late. I even had access to candy, a once-a-year treat while living under the roof of my Tiger Mom. Then at some point in my twenties, Chinese New Year became a chore. As an adult, Chinese New Year is an annual nightmare, for the following reasons:

1. I find it sucks when you are single

Relatives feel that they have a right to judge you because you do share bits of DNA, so, really, it's almost like they're judging themselves. Typically, the extended family gathers for Chinese New Year and spends an inordinate amount of time together, during which people get bored and focus their restlessness on judging the younger generation, particularly those who are single. Singledom means a lack of responsibilities and responsibility-free people need to be reined in by the wisdom of elders, or they will be reckless with their directionless lives. Here are some unavoidable conversations at Chinese New Year. By "conversations" I really mean monologues by one Wise Elder or another, fired away at a particular Single Younger in a trance-like manner:

"Why don't you have a boyfriend? Second Cousin Yong Yong will have to start bringing clothes from America for you." Blue is not such a good color for us Chinese people." 2. And it's the guilt from feeling disappointed that makes me really hate Chinese New Year for making me hate myself. It's the thought that counts.
