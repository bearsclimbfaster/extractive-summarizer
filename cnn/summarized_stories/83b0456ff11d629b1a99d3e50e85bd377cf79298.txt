Undercover government investigators were able to get into major U.S. seaports -- at one point driving a vehicle containing a simulated explosive -- by flashing counterfeit or fraudulently obtained port "credentials" to security officials -- raising serious questions about a program that has issued the cards to more than 1.6 million people, Congress disclosed Tuesday. At issue are Transportation Worker Identification Credentials, or TWIC cards, now needed by truckers, stevedores, longshoreman and others for unescorted access to the nation's ports. The Department of Homeland Security has long touted the cards as one of the most important layers in its multilayered system to protect ports from terrorists. But, in a highly critical report, the Government Accountability Office said Tuesday the program does not provide reasonable assurance that only qualified people get the credentials. "This investigation raises a disturbing question: Are America's ports actually safer now than they were a decade ago?" said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey.
