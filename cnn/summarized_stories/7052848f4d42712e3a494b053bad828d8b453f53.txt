Arsenal were held to a frustrating goalless home draw by Sunderland in the English Premier League Saturday as they missed the chance to close to within a point of leaders Manchester United.

Andrey Arshavin had the ball in the net, but it was ruled out for offside as TV replays showed the opposite. But it's absolutely disappointing and unacceptable," added Wenger.
