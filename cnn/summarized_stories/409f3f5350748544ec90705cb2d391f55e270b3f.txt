The United States, along with the United Kingdom and Canada, is refusing to sign a United Nations treaty on telecommunications and the Internet that has been under negotiation for the past two weeks. Terry Kramer, the U.S. Ambassador to the World Conference on International Telecommunications, said Thursday that "the U.S. cannot sign the [treaty] in [its] current form." "We candidly cannot support an ITU treaty that is inconsistent with a multi-stakeholder model of Internet governance," said Kramer during a conference session. "This has not happened here." The U.S. decision to withdraw comes following a surprise move late Wednesday in which the chair of the conference called a voice vote on controversial proposal that encourages governments to help expand global Internet access.
