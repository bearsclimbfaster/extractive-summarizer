When Egypt's first democratically elected president was tossed out this year, the White House stopped short of calling it a coup. Doing so would have forced an end to the $1.23 billion that the United States sends in military aid a year -- and changed the course of its relationship with its strongest Arab ally in the region. But that was before Wednesday, when the military-led interim government stormed two camps full of former President Mohamed Morsy's supporters. More than 525 people were killed and 3,717 wounded in the bloodiest day in Egypt's recent history, officials there said. On Thursday, President Barack Obama condemned the violence against civilians and announced the United States is canceling next month's joint U.S.-Egyptian military exercises. But will the carnage in Egypt spur more changes in U.S. policy toward the most populous Arab country? And might the hardening U.S. stance affect Egypt's own approach?

The United States helps Egypt in part because it's one of only two Arab countries -- along with Jordan -- that made peace with Israel. In return, Egypt gets more than $1 billion each year in U.S. taxpayer money for military and civilian programs. "The reality is that the Egyptian military has not only been a source of stability for the United States in an otherwise turbulent Middle East, but it has also been a cash cow," said Khairi Abaza, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. "We need to have a discussion about the costs and benefits of different relationships with the Egyptians, and the Egyptians need to have the same about their relationship with us," said Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
