No major security problems were reported at Michael Jackson's public memorial service on Tuesday in Los Angeles, California, according to police. Police gather Tuesday morning in Los Angeles for Michael Jackson's public memorial. The only controversy concerned the issue of who ultimately would pay for the city's efforts to heighten security as thousands of people from around the world flooded the city to say farewell to the pop icon, who died of unknown causes on June 25. It set up a Web site where fans can donate. Matt Szabo, spokesman for Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, said providing security at the event was the city's "obligation" and its "No. 1 priority." Los Angeles City Councilman Dennis Zine on Monday called for AEG, the company that owns the Staples Center, to cover all costs of the memorial, arguing the public should not foot any of the bill, according to the Los Angeles Times.
