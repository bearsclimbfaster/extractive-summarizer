The U.S Army has granted a member of a religious minority permission to keep his turban, beard and uncut hair while he serves in the military, the Pentagon and a group representing him said. Capt. Kamaljit Singh Kalsi, a doctor, is a Sikh, a faith that calls on its adherents not to shave or cut their hair. Kalsi filed a request in the spring for an accommodation to follow the principles of his religion. The Pentagon public affairs office later confirmed that Kalsi would be allowed to keep his turban, beard and uncut hair. The civil rights group hailed the move as "a major step toward ending a 23-year-old policy that excludes Sikhs from service." "Like the many Sikhs who fought before me, I know I will serve America with honor and excellence," he said in a written statement. Maj. Gen. Gina Farrisee said in the letter that Kalsi's "beard, uncut hair, and turban will be neat and well maintained at all times."
