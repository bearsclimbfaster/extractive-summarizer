He's a Rolls Royce footballer who honed his game in his parents' garage. And even at the age of 40, former Juventus star Alessandro Del Piero is still purring along, showing no signs of running out of gas. The record-breaking striker is currently enjoying an Indian summer to his football career, completing stints at Sydney FC in Australia and more recently at the Delhi Dynamos in the inaugural Indian Super League. I love every moment like the first one," Del Piero told CNN's Human to Hero series. The man dubbed "Il Pinturicchio" ("the little artist") has enjoyed a glittering career for both country and club in Italy. During 19 seasons at Juventus he won 15 trophies including six Serie A crowns and a European Champions League title, as well as setting club records for appearances and goals. In all, Del Piero made 705 appearances for the Bianconeri -- including a record 478 in Serie A -- and scored 289 goals along the way. Del Piero turned professional at the age of 17, joining Serie B side Padova in 1991 before being snapped up by Juventus for â‚¬2.6 million two years later. Del Piero scored five times in 11 appearances in his debut season before making his breakthrough the following year, becoming a first-team regular standing in for injured star striker Roberto Baggio. While Baggio will forever be remembered for missing a penalty kick that handed Brazil victory in the 1994 FIFA World Cup final, Del Piero has cause to reflect on happier times on football's biggest stage. After being part of two unsuccessful campaigns in 1998 and 2002, Del Piero and Italy hit the jackpot in 2006 in Germany, beating France on penalties in a final remembered primarily for Zinedine Zidane's headbutt on Italy defender Marco Materazzi.
