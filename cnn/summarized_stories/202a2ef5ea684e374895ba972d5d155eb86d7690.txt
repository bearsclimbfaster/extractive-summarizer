Hurricane Isaac contributed to a moist air mass that brought torrential rainfall and street flooding Tuesday in Charleston, South Carolina, officials said. "We were stranded and had to be rescued ourselves," said Charleston County spokeswoman Tracey Amick. It's ridiculous right now. The tropical moisture, combined with a trough of low pressure off the coast, prompted a flash-flood warning in the city that was to continue until 12:30 a.m. Wednesday.
