Authorities are investigating whether it was an extreme case of bullying that led to the death of a 17-year-old student in Argentina, after she was attacked by two women and another girl last week. Naira Cofreces died Sunday of multiple injuries, including bruising to the left side of her brain, officials said. "First there was a verbal altercation and then she was kicked, punched and Naira's head was smashed against a wall," Judge Maria Laura Durante told Telam, the Argentine state news agency. Officials say the teen was attacked last Wednesday at about 10 p.m., after leaving the night school she attended in the city of JunÃ­n, about 260 kilometers (161 miles) west of Buenos Aires. We have testimony that suggests the motive could've been another girl or because they (the victim and her friends) acted as if they were more beautiful than the rest and dressed better than them," Durante told Telam.
