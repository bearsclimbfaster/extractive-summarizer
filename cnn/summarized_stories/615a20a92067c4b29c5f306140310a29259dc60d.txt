Republicans are predicting big wins in the November midterms. Across the aisle, Democrats are saying the same thing about their chances at the polls. Republicans speculate that they will take back the House -- and possibly the Senate -- as voters express their frustration at where Democrats and President Obama are taking the country. "I think it's pretty clear that the American people are tired of the job-killing agenda in Washington, D.C. They want the spending spree to stop," House Minority Leader John Boehner said on "Fox News Sunday." "I think we're having a good year, but we've got a lot of work to do before the Election Day on November 2," he said. Boehner advised Republicans heading home for the August recess to "talk about the better solutions that Republicans have been offering over the last 18 months." His counterpart in the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, encouraged her members to do the opposite. They've been elected there. Sen. Carl Levin, a Democrat from Michigan, said that although his party will probably lose a couple of seats, "it's going to be a lot better than what people now look at." This year, 37 seats are up for grabs in the Senate, and 18 of those are considered at least somewhat vulnerable, according to The Rothenberg Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter covering campaigns and politics. In order to net control, Republicans need to pick up 39 seats in the House and 10 in the Senate, said Nathan Gonzales, political editor of The Rothenberg Political Report.
