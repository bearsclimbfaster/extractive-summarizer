Mexican boxer Juan Manuel Marquez wants a third clash with Manny Pacquiao following Saturday night's successful defense of his WBA and WBO lightweight titles. The 37-year-old stopped Australia's Michael Katsidis on a technical knockout in the ninth round in Las Vegas to take his record to 52-5 with 38 KOs. The only draw of his career came against Pacquiao in 2004 when he retained his WBA and IBF featherweight titles, but he lost his WBC super featherweight belt in a controversial split decision to the Filipino in 2008. We will put a lot of work into it, and a third fight is what the public wants to see," Marquez told reporters after beating Katsidis, whose brother Stathi -- a horse-racing jockey -- died last month.
