The White House is planning a "very aggressive sales job" that will involve the Vice President, cabinet members and travel across the nation for President Barack Obama's executive action on immigration, a top White House aide said Friday. Speaking at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor, White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer told reporters that after Friday's address on the topic in Las Vegas, Obama will head to Chicago next Tuesday to speak with activists. The sales pitch, which Pfeiffer called a "very important priority," will continue beyond December, with travel across the nation. "[The President will] first make the case to the country about what we did, why we did it, explain to the country why it's consistent with past presidents of both parties," Pfeiffer said, adding a key component will also be educating the nearly 5 million undocumented immigrants the move could help on how to apply to the program.
