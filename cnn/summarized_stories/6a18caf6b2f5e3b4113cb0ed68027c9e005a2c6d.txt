The Euro crisis is not just a Greek crisis, or an Italian crisis, or now even a French crisis. It is an American crisis, too, a crisis that may thrust the U.S. economy back into recession in 2012. If the Euro cracks up, many European banks who hold Euro-denominated bonds will discover that their bonds have lost value. The bank crisis will translate into a severe Europe-wide recession, just as the U.S. financial crisis of 2008 created a severe recession in 2009. documented by Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart in their now-classic study, "This Time It's Different." The European Union represents a bigger economy even than the United States. If the euro cracks, and euro-holding banks fails, the pain will cross the Atlantic, as the pain of the U.S. crash of 2008 crossed the Atlantic in the opposite direction. European financial institutions may lose the ability to repay U.S. creditors, inflicting more losses on an already traumatized U.S. financial system. Collectively, the eurozone countries are far and away the largest foreign investor in the United States. If the eurozone economies slump, Americans will find it harder to raise capital for new projects and businesses. As a single economy, the EU is America's largest trading partner. The United States is not helpless to avert this crisis. In fact, the United States could play an important role to avert the crisis, not only with money (although money may be needed), but also by standing with those Europeans willing to run the political risks to address the crisis.
