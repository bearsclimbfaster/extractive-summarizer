At Google's Gmail Labs work area, employees' e-mail ideas are made into reality. To address this problem, Google Inc.'s Gmail Labs has launched an experimental feature called "Undo Send" that gives users a chance to rewrite their message, correct settings or simply fix typos. When a Gmail user who enables this feature sends an e-mail, a button that says "Undo" will pop up on their screen for five seconds. "Sometimes ... I send a message and then immediately notice a mistake," said Michael Leggett, a Gmail Labs designer and the creator of the "Undo Send" feature, in the Gmail blog. I can rush to close my browser or unplug the Internet -- but Gmail almost always wins that race." Leggett added that he's had "Undo Send" turned on for a while "and it's saved me several times." This may be good news to Gmail's tens of millions of users as people in the digital era look to connect with others over the Web in a more efficient manner. "Undo Send" is also just the latest example of the dozens of creative -- and sometimes downright wacky -- online features developed at Gmail Labs to address common e-mail problems. Gmail users can enable the Gmail Labs settings by going to their settings tab. Google's Gmail Labs also typifies the Mountain View, California-based company's reputation for innovation and brainstorming.
