Two men convicted of killing a British soldier on a London street last year were sentenced Wednesday, one to life in prison and the other to a minimum of 45 years. In a brutal attack recorded on closed-circuit TV and by bystanders, Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale hit soldier Lee Rigby with a car then hacked him to death with a meat cleaver and knives in May 2013. The Islamic converts, through testimony or their lawyers' arguments in court, indicated they killed Rigby for Allah. Cellphone footage replayed at the trial showed Adebolajo, still clutching a cleaver in his bloody hands, ranting that the killing was "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth" for British soldiers killing Muslims overseas. They were convicted of murder in December. Adebolajo will spend life in prison. Adebowale received a sentence of at least 45 years.
