The bodies of two children trapped inside a car submerged in the Edisto River in South Carolina have been recovered, and their mother has been arrested, authorities said Monday. State troopers responded to a report of a car accident early Monday and found a Chrysler sedan in the water near a boat landing in Orangeburg County. Their mother is 29-year-old Shaquan Duley, Sheriff Larry Williams told HLN's Nancy Grace. It wasn't immediately known whether Duley had retained an attorney.
