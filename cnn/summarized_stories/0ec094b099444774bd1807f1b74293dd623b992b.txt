In matters regarding Nigeria, the international community seems to be learning from experience. When more than 200 girls were in April 2014 kidnapped by Boko Haram terrorists from their school in Chibok, the international community rallied around Nigeria. From Michelle Obama to Alicia Keys to Malala Yousafzai, personalities from across the globe lent their voices to the #BringBackOurGirls social media campaign. This response contrasted greatly to the relative apathy which followed what has been described by Amnesty International as Boko Haram's deadliest attack -- the massacre of up to 2,000 mostly women and children in Baga town of northeast Nigeria last week. At about the same time that the Baga bloodbath was making headlines around the world, the international community was rallying around France in support against the terrorist attacks on the Charlie Hebdo newspaper offices in Paris, giving rise to the #JeSuisCharlie social media campaign. A simultaneous #IAmBaga social media campaign has failed to gain much steam. The Igbo proverb points out that a man cannot expect you to both marry a wife for him and then buy the new couple a bed on which to sleep. Similarly, a country is expected to take responsibility and set sail with the winds of global support. So far, he has said nothing about Baga.
