Vincent "Buddy" Cianci has been mayor of Providence, Rhode Island -- twice. Now, he wants back in. Cianci announced Wednesday on his weekday radio show that he intends to seek a third go as the mayor of Rhode Island's capital and biggest city, feeling he's the best bet for Providence's future regardless of his own past. He was an Army veteran and prosecutor when he became mayor the first time in 1975, quickly establishing himself as a character and significant actor in the New England city. That stemmed from an incident that year at his Providence home, in which he used his hands and a lit cigarette to assault a man he accused of having an affair with his estranged wife, with a uniformed policeman nearby -- an account detailed in court records and documented by then-Providence Journal reporter Mike Stanton. As part of the plea deal, Cianci never went to prison -- getting five years of probation on the assault with a dangerous weapon charge and one year's probation on the simple assault charge -- but was forced to leave his job as mayor.
