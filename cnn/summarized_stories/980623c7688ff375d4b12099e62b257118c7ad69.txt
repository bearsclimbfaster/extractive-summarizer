It was the goal that broke a thousand Chelsea hearts. Almost three years ago, Andreas Iniesta fired an incredible shot in the nail-biting final moments of a European Champions League semifinal at Stamford Bridge. Scored in the last minute of stoppage time, it secured a 1-1 draw and put Barcelona into the final on away goals. Iniesta's ecstatic team then took the title in Rome, beating Chelsea's English rivals Manchester United. On Wednesday, the Spanish champions will return to London to face Chelsea for the first time since that fateful day on May 6, 2009 in the first leg of this season's semifinal.
