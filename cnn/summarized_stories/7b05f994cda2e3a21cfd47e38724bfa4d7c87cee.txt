The United Kingdom may seem an unlikely candidate to lead a renewable energy revolution; it doesn't have much sun for solar power, it doesn't have much space for wind power and it doesn't have giant coursing rivers for hydro. Energy companies in Scotland and Wales are seeing the potential from underwater turbines which tap a constant and predictable source of energy, are invisible and can produce as much electricity as a conventional wind turbine. If a test project in the fast flowing marine waters of Pentland Firth in the far north of Scotland goes well, submerged turbines could eventually power as many as 400,000 Scottish homes, according to the Scottish-government backed scheme. Predictable flow

"The demonstration array at the moment is 6MW or four turbines. Hopefully this will be the catalyst for further investment," MeyGen CEO Dan Pearson told CNN. Safe for sea life?
