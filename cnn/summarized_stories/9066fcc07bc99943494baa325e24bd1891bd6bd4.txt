A former personal assistant to Nigella Lawson told a court Friday that the celebrity chef had lied in her testimony as a prosecution witness. Elisabetta Grillo, who is accused alongside her sister Francesca of embezzling hundreds of thousands of pounds from Lawson and her ex-husband, Charles Saatchi, insisted under cross-examination she had told the truth in her own defense. On Thursday, Elisabetta Grillo testified that over the years she had worked for the family, she had seen signs of cocaine use by Lawson "every three days, I don't know, regularly." In her testimony last week, Lawson confirmed she had taken cocaine half a dozen times and used cannabis in the past. In the e-mail, which the defense shared with the court in a pretrial hearing, Saatchi wrote that the two assistants would probably "get off" because Lawson was using cocaine and marijuana on a daily basis and "allowed the sisters to spend whatever they liked."
