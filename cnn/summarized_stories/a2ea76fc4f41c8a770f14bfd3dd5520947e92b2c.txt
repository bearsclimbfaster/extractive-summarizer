Inter Milan survived an early sending-off and a Barcelona onslaught to reach the final of Europe's Champions League, where they will meet Bayern Munich. The Italian champions were reduced to 10 men when Thiago Motta was dismissed after 28 minutes, but defended resolutely and clung on for a 1-0 defeat in the Nou Camp which gave them a 3-2 victory on aggregate. Can Mourinho beat Van Gaal to become king of Europe? We made it and we will go to Madrid."
