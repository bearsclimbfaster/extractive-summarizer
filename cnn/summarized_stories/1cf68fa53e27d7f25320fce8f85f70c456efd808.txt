A thick pall of chemical smoke hung over a crowd in Cairo on Friday afternoon. The same scene was being played out elsewhere in Cairo, in Alexandria and Suez. In both Tunisia and Egypt, some protesters stopped to pick up canisters, and posted photographs online. A few inches long, blue and silver, they include warning labels and then a set of initials: CSI, followed by "Made in the U.S.A."

The photograph posted in Tunisia was of a 40 mm riot CS smoke projectile, made by a company called Combined Systems Inc., which describes itself as a "tactical weapons company" and is based in Jamestown, Pennsylvania. CSI's website describes the projectile as "a launched burning extended-range single projectile round that dispenses smoke or chemical agents via rapid burning. Its warning label reads: "Danger: Do not fire directly at person(s). The 32-year-old was a photographer for the European PressPhoto Agency. It, too, was made by CSI.
