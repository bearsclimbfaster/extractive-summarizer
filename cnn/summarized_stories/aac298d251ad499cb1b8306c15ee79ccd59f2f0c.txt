Jessica Ennis is set to cash in after winning heptathlon gold for Olympic hosts Great Britain, but fame and fortune are not the motivation for the poster girl of London 2012. "If there was no money, I'd still be here doing it. However, Ennis is aware of some of the commercial opportunities that will come her way in the aftermath of the Games

"I also want to enjoy some of the things that are going to come up as well as a result of this but more than anything I'm just so happy and relieved I was able to get the gold and that's the most important thing for me," she said.
