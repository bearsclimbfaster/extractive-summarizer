Protesters shut down a San Francisco subway station Monday, angry about a transit police officer shooting a drunk man at a station earlier this month. That officer was eventually found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in Oscar Grant's death. They reeled off a number of chants including "No justice, no peace" and "Murderers, justice."
