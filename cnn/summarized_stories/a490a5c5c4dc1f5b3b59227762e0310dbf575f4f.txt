Icelandic photographer Sigga Ella wanted to show that people with Down syndrome are more than a chromosomal abnormality. Ella's series, "First and foremost I am," consists of 21 portraits of people ranging from 9 months to 60 years old. It is currently on exhibit at the Reykjav√≠k Museum of Photography and will be featured in May at the Warsaw Festival of Art Photography. She recently shared the images with CNN iReport. It's not a disease or a flaw.
