The National Transportation Safety Board said Wednesday that the federal government should mandate the systems as standard equipment in all cars and commercial vehicles. But the NTSB said the time is ripe for the federal government to require the systems in all vehicles, saying their "full life-saving and crash-avoidance potential will not be realized" until the government mandates the systems and sets standards for their performance. "We know that hundreds of lives can be saved and hundreds of thousands of injuries can be prevented if the technology improves and we can avoid these run-off-the-road, rear-end and also the side lane departure collisions," NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman told CNN. The safety board called for the change in its updated "Most Wanted List" of transportation safety improvements. Meanwhile, the board removed "fatigue" from its list. Fatigue, which has been on the list since it was first created in 1990, was removed largely because the board feels the issue is being addressed, a board spokesperson said.
