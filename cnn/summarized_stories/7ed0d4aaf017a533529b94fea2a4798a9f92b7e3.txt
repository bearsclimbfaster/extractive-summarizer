Basim Usmani is bassist for The Kominas, a group that blends traditional sounds with punk rock beats. They're young. They're punk. "A lot of times people say, 'Oh wow, look, brown people playing music' [but] it's more than that," said 25-year-old Pakistani-American Shahjehan Khan, the lead singer for a Muslim punk band, The Kominas. The Boston-based band is one of a handful of Muslim punk bands that emerged in the United States in the past few years. The members of this four-person rock group with South Asian roots hold varying views on religion. One says he's an atheist; three others identify as Muslims -- both practicing and non-practicing. For them, punk music is a way to rebel against their conservative cultural upbringing and the frustrations of growing up a young Muslim in America. We actually might be offering some sort of insights for people at large about religion, about the world," said 26-year-old bassist Basim Usmani. Audio slide show: On tour with Muslim punk rockers »
