Akilah Monifa wasn't a foodie until she lost 222 pounds. The San Francisco-based communications director says she never used to taste her food. "I ate a lot of junk, and I wasn't mindful about what I ate," Monifa said. For her it was a real sacrifice. "I would drink maybe six to eight Diet Cokes a day. I know people think it's OK to drink since it doesn't have calories, but I realized I never really had it on its own," Monifa said. After that she stopped eating the M&Ms, their bright colors always taunting her from the bowl at a woman's desk outside her office door. The tipping point

At her heaviest, Monifa weighed over 400 pounds. Monifa, 57, doesn't know exactly how she put on the weight. "I don't know at what point I remember thinking, 'Woops, I'm over 200 pounds now,'" Monifa said. Subconsciously, she may have been avoiding situations where she'd have to confront it. Then it became I'll never weigh more than 250, then 300, then 350. Then it became 400," Monifa said. "Right when I was thinking about it, I got a call from a friend who said that woman had passed," Monifa said. Her insurance covered a program at Stanford. He was also from Alabama, which is where Monifa grew up. In August 2012, she had surgery. Group therapy helped. It's that fancy.
