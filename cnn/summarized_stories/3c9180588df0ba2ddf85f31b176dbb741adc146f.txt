After an apparent attempted military coup on Saturday, the people of the African nation of Lesotho are doing their best to return to every day life. According to the South African Department of International Relations, Prime Minister Thomas Thabane has been forced into hiding because of the unfolding security situation and out of fear for his life. Thabane became Prime Minister in 2012 and the next elections are due in 2017. During an interview that aired Saturday with South African broadcaster eNCA, he told the broadcaster he would not resign his position. Lesotho has been praised for its coalition government and a peaceful handover of power in 2012. The whereabouts of the deputy prime minister, Mothetjoa Metsing, are also unknown. He has not officially taken power -- although it would be constitutional for him to do so, since the Prime Minister is not fulfilling his duties. Sometimes referred to as the "Kingdom of the Sky," Lesotho is completely landlocked by South Africa and is the only country in the world where all of the land lies above 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) in elevation. It has a predominantly Christian population of nearly 2 million people and covers an area slightly smaller than the U.S. state of Maryland, according to the World Factbook. It has been independent from the United Kingdom since 1966 but continues on as a member of the 53-nation Commonwealth.
