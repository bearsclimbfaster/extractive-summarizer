Allan Yang would be a success story in any country. Originally from China's impoverished interior, he was the first member of his family to leave his native Anhui province and is now pursuing an MBA at the prestigious Tsinghua University in Beijing. "You give an application letter and submit some reports that test your knowledge of Communist history." Arduous "observational periods" are required when prospective members are expected to read the classics of Socialism, become steeped in the party ideology and submit an unending series of essays that are little more than long paeans to the party's greatness. Though Yang admits few take this process seriously. "There are lots of things to download from the Internet, we just copy and paste," he chuckled. It is an irony not lost on Aaron Zhang. "When they say, 'I care about China,' my first instinct is not to believe them."
