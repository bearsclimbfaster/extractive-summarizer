We're up in the north central part of France -- Normandy -- to see what's happening with French cheese. Cheese from the Camembert region now carries the same cachet as a chateau label for wine. It has now a larger annual turnover than the steel industry in France (which admittedly is in decline.) Philippe Meslon, the mayor of Saint-Loup de Fribois and the administrator of the Saint-Loup cheese works says: "A camembert not made out of raw milk is like making love without sex. "A Frenchman is someone who cultivates with modern evolution his past. It's someone who protects moral values, cultural values and artistic values, and when I say cultural values I would include camembert." That's true.
