Monsignor Cristobal Garcia was quoted in the October issue of National Geographic directing a reporter to ivory carvers and traders, and also dispensing advice on how to smuggle the banned item into the United States. He was with the Cebu Archdiocese when he allegedly made his remarks to the magazine. This caught the Philippines authorities' interest. Garcia has not been charged with any crime and his collection has not been confiscated.
