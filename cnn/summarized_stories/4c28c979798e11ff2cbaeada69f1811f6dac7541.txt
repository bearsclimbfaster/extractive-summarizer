Apple's new iPad wasn't the only game in town this week. More than 18,000 videogame makers gathered in San Francisco at the 26th annual Game Developers Convention (GDC 2012) to discuss the future of interactive entertainment. While there was plenty of talk about the explosion of casual and social games and how new smartphones and tablets are luring even more users into gaming, there were also plenty of brand new "AAA" games debuting at the Moscone Center and surrounding area hotels. "What always amazes me at a show like GDC is the fact that there's always a smoke chasing vibe about what's hot and what's interesting this year," said Cliff Bleszinski, design director at Epic Games, which was showcasing its new Unreal Engine 4 technology at the show. But I'm of the belief that we're here to remind people that AAA is here to stay and people will always want beautiful, $60-quality gaming experiences." The following are five big games that stood out at GDC that are worth picking up when they arrive later this year on a console, PC or gaming device:
