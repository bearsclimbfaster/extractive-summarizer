He's still a teenager, but Wilfredo Vasquez has already seen plenty in his life. His story begins in Anamoros, a city in southeastern El Salvador. At 16, alone, living in poverty, threatened by violent gangs in his neighborhood and practically abandoned by his parents, Vasquez decided to leave everything behind and migrate to the United States. "If you didn't join the gangs, they would kill you," Vasquez says, "and I didn't want to join because I knew if I did it, I could die very soon." Vasquez traveled by bus through Guatemala and crossed the Suchiate River illegally into Mexico. He then boarded a bus for the U.S. border. His Salvadoran accent betrayed him, but somehow he was let go.
