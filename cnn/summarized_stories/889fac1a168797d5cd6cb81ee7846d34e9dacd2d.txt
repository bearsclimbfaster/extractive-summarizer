U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Sunday that American forces can "deal with any potential contingencies" in the Middle East, especially after the military's capabilities were recently "enhanced" after attacks on U.S. diplomatic missions. Speaking to reporters en route to Tokyo, Panetta said recent unrest underscores the importance of having vibrant, flexible U.S. military capabilities in the region. That unrest includes an attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans, as well as violent protests near U.S. embassies in Egypt, Yemen, Tunisia and elsewhere. Outpourings soon spread like wildfire across the Muslim world.
