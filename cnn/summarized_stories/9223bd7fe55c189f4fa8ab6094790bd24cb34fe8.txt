Australian cricketer Phil Hughes is fighting for his life in hospital, a day after he was felled by a sickening blow from a ball during a televised match in Sydney. The 25-year-old batsman, who was playing for South Australia against New South Wales at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) Tuesday, collapsed after being struck by a "bouncer" from bowler Sean Abbott. After receiving treatment on the pitch, he was rushed to the city's St Vincent's Hospital, where he underwent neurosurgery. He's in the hands of some of the best specialists available for this type of injury so we'll just wait and see," hospital spokesman David Faktor told CNN Wednesday.
