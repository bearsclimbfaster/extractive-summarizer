Italy have admitted they do not know when star goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon will be able to return to action at the 2010 World Cup. Buffon, who helped Italy win the tournament in Germany four years ago, had to be substituted at half-time during his team's 1-1 draw with Paraguay on Monday because of a sciatic nerve problem.
