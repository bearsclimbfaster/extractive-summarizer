A federal judge on Friday ordered a North Carolina teacher to remain in custody until her trial over an alleged plot to behead witnesses who testified against a would-be terrorist. Nevine Aly Elshiekh was arrested with Shkumbin Sherifi on January 22. Just nine days earlier, the man they were allegedly in collusion with -- Hysen Sherifi, who is Shkumbin Sherifi's brother -- was sentenced to 45 years in prison for being part of what prosecutors called a "violent jihad" that had conspired to kill people overseas and kill a federal officer. A criminal complaint alleges that Elshiekh and the Sherifi brothers tried to pull off a plan to "murder and behead" three people who testified against Hysen Sherifi at his trial last year. Facing charges of conspiracy to commit murder, Elshiekh is on leave as director of special education at the Sterling Montessori Academy in Morrisville, North Carolina, a Raleigh-Durham suburb. The man listed in court documents as her lawyer, Charles Swift, did not immediately respond to messages Friday for comment.
