Passengers prepare for a security screening at Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia. More than 2,000 are already on the job, and the program is growing every day, said Christopher White, a spokesman for the Transportation Security Administration. "What the officers are looking for are physiological signs that cannot be manipulated that indicate stress, fear or deception," White said. The TSA has been taking steps to reduce stress for all travelers at security, such as adding special family lanes, to make it easier for the officers to spot passengers who are acting suspiciously. "By calming the checkpoint down, it makes people with potential hostile intent really stand out," White said. By now, most air travelers know the government's 3-1-1 rule for liquids and gels: Containers no larger than 3 ounces are allowed in carry-on luggage, provided they are packed into one quart-size clear plastic zip-top bag, with one bag allowed per person. What's not changing for the foreseeable future: taking your shoes off at security.
