Romania's president Traian Basescu was suspended on Friday, after the impeachment motion filed by the ruling coalition passed the Parliament's vote. Romania's coalition of Social Democrats and Liberals argued their action by saying that President Traian Basescu has breached the Constitution and overstepped his authority. The country is expected to hold a referendum on July 29, when Romanians will have to vote whether they want Basescu to remain in office. During the suspension, National Liberal Party leader Crin Antonescu, who is also the president of the Senate, will assume the interim presidency. This position allows him to assume the president's attributions, in case the latter is suspended, according to the Constitution. During his speech in parliament, before the vote, Basescu accused the ruling coalition of taking control of the country's judicial system and public institutions. He also expressed concern about the country's state of law and said this political turmoil will have long-term negative impacts on Romania. U.S.
