Pandora, the music-streaming service that's a soundtrack for many a desk-bound music lover, rolled out a slate of changes Wednesday, even as a host of up-and-comers are emerging in the online music space. "New Pandora," according to a post on the music service's blog, is "more responsive, easier to use, and better integrated with the friends and music lovers in your life." As of July, Pandora had 100 million registered users and 36 million monthly active users. Eric Mac of PCWorld gave the Pandora overhaul high marks.
