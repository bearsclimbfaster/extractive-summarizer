Manchester United's post-title hangover continued on Sunday after a 1-0 defeat that kept Chelsea in pole position for England's third Champions League place next season. Juan Mata netted the only goal in the 86th minute before the game erupted from its previous lethargy as United defender Rafael da Silva was sent off for kicking out at fellow Brazilian David Luiz. Television replays showed the Chelsea player smiling on the floor afterwards. It was United's first red card this season, and means Rafael will miss the rest of the Premier League campaign with an automatic three-game ban. "The referee was bought by the fact Luiz rolled about," United manager Alex Ferguson said.
