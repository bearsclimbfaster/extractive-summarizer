As the horror of explosions near the finish line of the nation's most famous marathon sank in, government officials mobilized to respond on Monday afternoon. FBI director Robert Mueller briefed President Barack Obama by telephone, the White House said. Aviation authorities banned planes from flying over of the site of the explosion, the Federal Aviation Administration said. It reaches up to a height of 3,000 feet, FAA spokeswoman Arlene Salac said. The agency ordered a brief ground stop at Boston's Logan airport but it did not last long.
