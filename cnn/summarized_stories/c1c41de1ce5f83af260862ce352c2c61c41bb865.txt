For some families, like the Kennedys, the Bushes and the Roosevelts, politics runs in the blood. George and Jeb Bush are the only sons of a president to make it to the governor's mansion. It's a two-edged sword," said Doug Wead, a presidential historian and former adviser to President George H.W. Only two presidential sons have followed their fathers to the White House (John Quincy Adams and George W. Bush), and just one presidential family -- the Bushes -- has sent sons to the governor's mansion (Jeb Bush in Florida and George Bush in Texas). "I conclude that a brand name -- a famous family name -- is typically worth one step up on the political ladder," said Stephen Hess, a senior fellow emeritus in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, who has researched and written about political dynasties dating back to colonial times. As they tried to step up to one higher level, both of them were defeated," noted Hess, who served as a staffer of the Eisenhower and Nixon administrations and as an adviser to Presidents Ford and Carter. Among some other high-profile names whose political aspirations came up short, William Taft's son Charles, who was the mayor of Cincinnati, Ohio, lost his bid to be the governor of the state; his other son -- Sen. Robert Taft -- tried three times without success to win the Republican nomination for president. President Reagan's daughter Maureen failed in her run for a California Senate seat, and the son of Hubert Humphrey -- a former vice president and Democratic presidential nominee -- was defeated in Minnesota's 1998 gubernatorial election, losing to third party candidate and ex-wrestler Jesse Ventura. Sometimes, the public wants a candidate to lose an election or two, "just to let them know that they cannot be taken for granted," said Wead, author of the 2004 book "All the Presidents' Children: Triumph and Tragedy in the Lives of America's First Families."
