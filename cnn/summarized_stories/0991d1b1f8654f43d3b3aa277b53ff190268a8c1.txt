Members of Latin America's largest guerrilla group declared Thursday they will ask for an immediate cease fire when they meet with Colombian government negotiators for peace talks next month. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -- known by the Spanish acronym FARC -- have waged a bloody civil war for five decades with the Colombian government and right-wing paramilitary groups. The group is considered by the United States government to be a terrorist organization. The discussions will begin on October 8 in Oslo, Norway, six FARC members said during a news conference held in Havana on Thursday. Time is right, but past failures haunt Colombia peace talks

Chile, Cuba, Venezuela and Norway have been named as countries that will aid in the negotiations.
