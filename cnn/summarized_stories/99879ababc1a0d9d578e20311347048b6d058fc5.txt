A federal appeals court has ruled that shoe designer Christian Louboutin can enforce a U.S. trademark of the red-lacquered sole that adorns the designer's footwear when it contrasts with the color of the rest of the shoe. The court also said Wednesday that the trademark does not apply when the shoe is monochromatic, such as Yves St. Laurent's designs that were entirely red. A lawsuit filed in June 2011 by Louboutin took issue with four specific shoes from YSL's Cruise 2011 Collection: the Tribute, Tribtoo, Palais and Woodstock models, saying they violated Louboutin's trademarked "lacquered red sole."
