I was going through my Twitter feed Monday morning when I came across this: "Happy greatest day of the year, #Boston!" Or was, until about 2:50 p.m., when explosions near the finish line of the Boston Marathon transformed a celebration into a scene of carnage. But if you are looking for some insight into Boston at this horrible moment, it helps to understand why our marathon matters and where it fits into our civic psyche. Why it was, until Monday, our greatest day of the year. That's why so many people descend on the marathon every year, and why so many people found themselves in harm's way. Moreover, just about everyone has a personal connection. Sadly, the marathon will not be the same after today.
