Consider it the taxonomist's equivalent of a People magazine's Most Beautiful List. An international committee made up of scientists and related experts has announced its top 10 of nearly 18,000 new species named in the previous year, according to a news release from the International Institute for Species Exploration, part of the State University of New York's College of Environmental Science and Forestry. The alphabetical list was launched in 2008 and is released each May 23, the birthday of 18th-century Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus, who is considered the father of modern taxonomy. Last summer, Scientists at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington announced the discovery of a new species of mammal called the olinguito (pronounced oh-lin-GHEE-toe) -- the first mammalian carnivore species to be newly identified in the Americas in 35 years, according to Kristofer Helgen, curator of mammals at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. The species, a relative of the Canary Island dragon tree, was identified on the limestone hills and mountains of Thailand. Setting out to test a camera-equipped robot, they discovered the Edwardsiella andrillae actually living in the ice. The translucent crustacean was collected from a cave on Santa Catalina, off the coast of Southern California. Leaf-tailed Gecko (Saltuarius eximius)

Location: Australia

You might have to look hard for this gecko. The Saltuarius eximius tends to sit and wait for its prey and usually comes out at night.
