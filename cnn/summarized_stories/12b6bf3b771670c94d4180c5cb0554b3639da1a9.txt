A strong storm system made driving dangerous in the Rockies and the upper Plains and contributed to a pileup involving about 100 vehicles Thursday near Fargo, North Dakota, officials said. "It is not fit for anyone to be out there," North Dakota State Highway Patrol Capt. Eldon Mehrer told CNN radio. Snow, ice and rain plagued much of the West, and North Dakota officials closed Interstate I-94 between Jamestown and Fargo and the north-south Interstate 29 from the Canadian border to South Dakota. In California, acting Gov. Maldonado is serving as the chief executive while Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is away from the state on vacation. Suburbs of Phoenix reported flurries.
