And her good friend, Krystle Campbell, was just lying there on the ground. Karen Rand -- she's Karen McWatters now -- dragged herself across the pavement. She wanted to get closer to Krystle so they could talk and take comfort from each other in the midst of so much chaos. "I got close to her, " she recalled. Krystle said that her legs hurt. The two women held hands until Krystle's went limp. McWatters was the fifth witness of the first day of the terror trial of accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who is accused of detonating pressure cooker bombs with his brother to punish the United States for policies they believe inflict suffering on Muslims. Three people were killed in the blasts: Campbell, a 29-year-old manager for a restaurant chain; Martin Richard, an 8-year-old boy; and Lingzi Lu, a 23-year-old grad student. Tsarnaev's attorneys chose not to cross-examine any of the survivors. Krystle's mouth is open, but she is very pale. "I was really scared," McWatters testified, "and I remember screaming for someone to help us. By the time first responders reached Krystle, it was too late. "They were doing CPR on Krystle and I started to think she didn't make it," McWatters said. She was confused. When Krystle's parents rushed to her bedside and saw she wasn't their daughter, they were heartbroken, McWatters said. But descriptions of the other two deaths at the marathon and the death of a police officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will come soon. Shane O'Hara, the manager at Marathon Sports, a running store near where the bombs went off, said it sounded like a loud cannon, followed by an instant cloud of smoke that covered the windows.
