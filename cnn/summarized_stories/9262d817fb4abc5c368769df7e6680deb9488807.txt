A Microsoft executive took to the tech giant's official blog Wednesday to take an uncharacteristically direct shot at rival Apple. "Seems like the RDF (Reality Distortion Field) typically generated by an Apple event has extended beyond Cupertino," wrote Frank Shaw, Microsoft's vice president of communications. Shaw was referring to coverage of Apple's rollout of two new iPads -- the iPad Air and revamped iPad Mini -- and other announcements. "Now, since iWork has never gotten much traction, and was already priced like an afterthought, it's hardly that surprising or significant a move," Shaw said.
