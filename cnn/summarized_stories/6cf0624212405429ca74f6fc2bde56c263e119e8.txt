A former deputy testified last week that he overheard the defendant in the "American Sniper" murder trial explain why he killed two men. Gene Cole, who worked for the Erath County Sheriff's Office at the time, testified Friday that on June 22, 2013, he "heard Mr. [Eddie Ray] Routh say, 'I shot them because they wouldn't talk to me. I'm sure they've forgiven me.'" Testimony resumes Monday in Routh's trial. He is charged with murder in the February 2, 2013, shooting deaths of Chris Kyle, the former Navy SEAL who was the subject of "American Sniper," and Kyle's friend, Chad Littlefield, at a firing range. Routh's lawyer admits his client killed the men but contends he was insane at the time. In other testimony, Texas Ranger David Armstrong said investigators searched Routh's residence and found drug paraphernalia, including a pipe commonly used for methamphetamine as well as "a ceramic pipe, what's believed to be a bong, a grinder used to grind different substances and a loose leafy green substance" which lab tests confirmed was marijuana. Routh's uncle, James Watson, testified that on the day of the slayings he was rousted out of bed by a call from Routh's girlfriend, asking him to come over because she and Routh had been arguing. Hours later, Routh showed up at Watson's home and allegedly said, "I'm driving a dead man's truck" -- apparently a reference to Kyle's truck, which he allegedly stole after the killings.
