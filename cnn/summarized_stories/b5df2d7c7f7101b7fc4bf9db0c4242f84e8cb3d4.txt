An explosion Wednesday afternoon rocked a parking lot at a crowded plaza in Nigeria's capital, killing 21 people and injuring 52 others, authorities said. The blast happened about 4 p.m. in Abuja's "ever-busy Emab Plaza ... at the peak of business," said Ezekiel Manzo, spokesman for Nigeria's National Emergency Management Agency. Ibrahim Abdullahi told CNN he was in a nearby office when he heard a "loud and terrifying sound."
