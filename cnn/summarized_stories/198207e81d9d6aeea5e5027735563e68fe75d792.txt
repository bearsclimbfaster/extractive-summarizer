Spain's answer to Susan Boyle took to the stage in a national talent show and produced a jaw-dropping display of athletic ability to win the competition. The show-stopper was 75-year-old British grandmother Paddy Jones who reportedly returned to dancing just five years ago after the death of her husband. Clips of Jones' performance on "Tu Si Que Vales," the Spanish equivalent of "Britain's Got Talent," are attracting hits on video-sharing site YouTube and comments including "wonderful," "excellent" and "incredible woman!!" We're absolutely over the moon. It's absolutely wonderful."
