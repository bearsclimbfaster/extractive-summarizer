Raul Castro's government in Cuba continues to repress civil rights and persecute dissenters three years after he became the communist nation's top leader, Human Rights Watch says in a report released Wednesday. Raul Castro took over in July 2006, when older brother Fidel became ill and was no longer able to rule after more than 47 years in charge. The new dictator has locked up scores of people and allowed scores more that had been jailed by Fidel Castro to remain behind bars, Human Rights Watch says. Its evaluation of human rights in Cuba is illegitimate and illegal." "Everyone thought there would be change, but there is no change," said Angel Padilla, head of the Disidente Universal group in Puerto Rico. "While there has been some economic reforms and political openings under Raul, the human rights picture has worsened. "Raul's inner circle have unbridled contempt for the dissidents," Bardach told CNN. The research uncovered more than 40 cases in which Cuba jailed citizens under the "dangerousness" provision.
