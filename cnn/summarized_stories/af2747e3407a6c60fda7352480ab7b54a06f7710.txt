CNN followed two die-hard football fans as they traveled to Rome to watch their teams battle to become champions of Europe. Ivan Papell partied until the early hours after seeing Barcelona win the champions League final. Ivan Papell is a Barcelona fan and managing director of the Spanish arm of a multinational company. He is in high spirits today after seeing his team beat Manchester United 2-0, but confesses to being a little tired. He didn't make it to bed until six o'clock this morning after partying the night away with thousands of other Barcelona fans,

"It was a great night for Barcelona, but I've lost my voice from screaming," he told CNN. He traveled to Moscow to see his team beat Chelsea in last year's Champions League final, but United were unable to repeat their success last night.
