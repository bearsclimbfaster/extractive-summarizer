Two of the most experienced sides in the World Cup face off against each other Tuesday, including the host Brazil, the only country never to have missed a World Cup. Brazil's match against Mexico will be the South American giant's 99th match since the tournament began in 1930. But Mexico's players are no slouches. This is the 15th time the country has made it to the World Cup, putting it fourth behind Brazil (20 times), Italy and Germany (18 each), and Argentina (16). The game against Brazil will be its 51st Cup match.
