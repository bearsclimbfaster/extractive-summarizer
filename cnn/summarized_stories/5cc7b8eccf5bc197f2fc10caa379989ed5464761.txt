Florida authorities were searching Sunday for a 33-year-old man after his wife and five children were found dead in their Naples home. Mesac Damas pleaded no contest to the misdemeanor battery against Guerline Damas in June. The bodies of Guerline Damas, 32; Michzach, 9; Marven, 6; Maven, 5; Megan, 3; and Morgan, 11 months, were discovered Saturday, Rambosk said. "We don't see at this point any indication of an individual out in the neighborhoods committing additional crimes or homicides, but certainly we will look at every opportunity," Collier County Sheriff Kevin Rambosk said at an earlier news conference.
