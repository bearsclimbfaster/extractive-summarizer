Last summer an EF3 tornado ripped through my town, Monson, Massachusetts. We had no directly storm-related deaths in Monson, despite the rarity of a tornado in our region. We were prepared, whether through federal programs or memory of the movie Twister, to shelter and ride out the storm. The tornado took its toll -- more than 270 homes in Monson sustained damage. Eventually a system emerged, coordinated largely by the First Church of Monson and a few dedicated local volunteers. We have been working with communities and emergency managers across the country to deploy the system through our company, Recovers.org. Their qualifications? They live here. Disaster recovery is changing in the United States. While large aid organizations like the Red Cross and Salvation Army can mobilize massive amounts of crucial resources, they often do not manage spontaneous donations, track local volunteer hours, or stay long term. They do it on Post-It notes, or Facebook, but they get it done. TED.com: Reporting crisis via texting

Community-powered recovery is simple, and it happens everywhere. I point to tornado recovery in Joplin, Missouri; the Broadmoor neighborhood in New Orleans following Katrina; and the small town of Forney, Texas, after an EF3 tornado. If you don't have a system for recording the names and contact information of people who would like to donate or volunteer until Week 2, you've missed out on perhaps 50% of all resources that will ever be reported.
