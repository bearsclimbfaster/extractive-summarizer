A part-time actor has been accused of killing his neighbor and then luring the victim's friend to her death in an attempt to cover up his crime, authorities in California said. The Costa Mesa Police Department last week charged Daniel Wozniak, 27, with two counts of murder. Wozniak is being held without bail and will be arraigned June 25, said Farrah Emami, spokesperson for the Orange County District Attorney's Office.
