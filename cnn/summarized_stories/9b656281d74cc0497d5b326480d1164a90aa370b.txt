A young mother in Washington state has been charged with attempted murder after authorities say she cut her children's throats in an attempt to keep them quiet. Over the weekend, Christina Booth called 911 to report that her three children were crying nonstop and "needed medical attention," according to a recent probable cause filing. The 28-year-old and her husband, Thomas Booth, have three children, a 2-year-old and 6-month-old twins. When officers arrived at the Olympia, Washington, home Saturday night, they found a troubling scene. All three were taken to a local hospital, where, CNN affiliate KOMO reports, they underwent surgery. A judge set bail for Booth at $3 million, KCPQ, another CNN affiliate, reported. As the movie wrapped up, Thomas Booth told police, his wife took the toddler upstairs to put her to bed, but then "a short time later Christina came down the stairs in only her underwear crying and screaming."

Christina Booth, like her husband, spoke to authorities without an attorney present.
