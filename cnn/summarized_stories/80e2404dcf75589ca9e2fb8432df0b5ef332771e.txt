Oracle Team USA will make its defense of the America's Cup in 2017 off the island of Bermuda, a British overseas territory in the Atlantic Ocean. The announcement was made Tuesday at a glitzy ceremony in New York, attended by Hollywood film stars Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones, who have been residents of Bermuda. "In Bermuda we have a perfect international venue to demonstrate the excitement America's Cup boats and teams can generate," commercial commissioner Harvey Schiller was quoted on the event's official website.
