The same day the man he fatally struck was laid to rest, NASCAR driver Tony Stewart's team announced that he won't be racing this weekend -- though it didn't rule a return to the track soon thereafter. In a brief statement, Stewart-Haas Racing said Thursday that Stewart "has decided not to compete" in Sunday's race in NASCAR's top division, the Sprint Cup Series. Jeff Burton will take his place in the No. 14 car in the Pure Michigan 400 at Michigan International Speedway. "The driver change pertains only to Michigan," the Stewart-Haas Racing team said. Stewart's future outside the track is also in question, as authorities investigate the death of fellow driver Kevin Ward Jr. at an August 9 Empire Super Sprints series dirt-track race in upstate New York.
