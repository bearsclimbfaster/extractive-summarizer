Interruptions in the emergency room may exact an unhealthy toll on patient care, a group of Australian researchers reported Thursday. The researchers, from the University of Sydney and the University of New South Wales, found that interruptions led emergency department doctors to spend less time on the tasks they were working on and, in nearly a fifth of cases, to give up on the task altogether. Doctors did not return to 18.5 percent of the interrupted tasks, according to the study, which was published in the journal Quality and Safety in Health Care. "It appears that in busy interrupt-driven clinical environments, clinicians reduce the time they spend on clinical tasks if they experience interruptions, and may delay or fail to return to a significant portion of interrupted tasks," concluded the authors, who were led by Johanna Westbrook, director of the health informatics research and evaluation unit on the Faculty of Health Sciences at the University of Sydney. "Now, most people think it's very acceptable to interrupt," but doing so can be dangerous, lead author Westbrook said.
