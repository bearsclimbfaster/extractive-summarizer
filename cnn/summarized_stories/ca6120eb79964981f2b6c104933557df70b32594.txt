Madeleine Pulver's ordeal started last August when a man burst into her room and tied a fake bomb around her neck, and ended on Tuesday when he was sentenced to at least 10 years in jail. The Australian teenager was studying for her final year exams when 52-year-old Paul Douglas Peters broke into her suburban Sydney home and carried out what the prosecution called an act of "urban terrorism." "The terror instilled can only be described as unimaginable," Judge Peter Zahra told the District Court in Sydney during sentencing Tuesday. Pulver was in the courtroom, as were her parents, and the man who, on a Wednesday afternoon, pushed open their unlocked front door and found the 18-year-old student alone in her bedroom. According to court documents, as Peters walked away, Pulver asked him where we was going. I'll be back ...if you move I can see you, I'll be right here," he replied. She waited. After a few minutes Pulver yelled out. There was no response. The note went on:

"If you disclose these Instructions, future instructions, any correspondence, Remittance instructions enclosures, direction or any other relevant fact outlined here or elsewhere, to any Federal or State agency, the Police or FBI, or to any non-family member, it will trigger an immediate BRIAN DOUGLAS WELLS event."

It's not clear whether the name Brian Douglas Wells meant anything to the Australian schoolgirl, but Peters had borrowed the name of an American pizza delivery man who was killed after a collar bomb fixed to his neck exploded in 2003.
