Convicted killer Joran van der Sloot is planning to wed a Peruvian woman in the prison where he is serving a 28-year sentence, his attorney told HLN, CNN's sister network, on Friday. Van der Sloot, who remains the prime suspect in the 2005 disappearance of American Natalee Holloway, and his unnamed fiancÃ©e are working on completing the paperwork required for the wedding, said attorney Maximo Altez. The couple hopes to be able to marry within the next two weeks, Altez said.
