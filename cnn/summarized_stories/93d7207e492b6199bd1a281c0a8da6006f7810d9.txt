For Leo Klink, the night was the payoff, the pinnacle, what you work most of your life for. It was the Hawaii state high school soccer championship, and Klink, a senior on the underdog Kalani Falcons, had state power Punahou in his sights. It was halftime, tied 1-1, thanks to Klink's chip shot over the Punahou keeper. In the stands on the night of February 9 were his proud parents, Paul and Hiroyo. "We were having a blast," Paul Klink said later. "It was halftime. We'd just seen Leo make a goal. If the Falcons could pull this off and win their first state championship, it would be thanks largely to Hiroyo. She was the one who introduced Leo, Kalani's star and last year's ESPN high school player of the year in Hawaii, to the sport when he was just 7. She was the one who spent hour after hour with Leo, working on his game when he needed to catch up with the other boys. "I wasn't that good at soccer," Leo said, explaining that his playing time was limited to three-minute spurts so the better players could catch a quick rest. "She helped me practice by myself at the park," Leo, 17, said. Leo and his teammates waited out the 10- to 15-minute delay before the ambulance rushed off. Leo assumed it was a Punahou player who'd hurt his back earlier in the game. Kalani coach Michael Ching knew differently. And, after the game went to overtime, and then penalty kicks, to decide the Hawaii state champion, that was Leo blasting the ball into the upper right corner of the net on Kalani's final shot for the deciding margin.
