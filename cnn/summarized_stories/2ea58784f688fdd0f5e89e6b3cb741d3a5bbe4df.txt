A hiker found the body of a skydiving instructor missing for nearly four months, police in Moab, Utah, said Wednesday. The state medical examiner's office positively identified the remains found Sunday near the west Kane Creek area as those of David Brown, 37, according to a police statement. "It's an extremely rough area," Moab Police Chief Mike Navarre told CNN Salt Lake City affiliate KSL.
