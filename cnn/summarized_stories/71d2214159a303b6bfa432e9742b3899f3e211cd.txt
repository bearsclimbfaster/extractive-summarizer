Cowering in a school restroom stall, young Charles D'Angelo would eat his lunch alone to escape classmates bullying him about his weight. A woman at his Catholic school's rectory let him watch the news with her during his break instead of playing outside. After losing 160 pounds, Charles D'Angelo got a shirtless picture of himself shown in Cosmopolitan. But before-and-after photos he posted on iReport.com show how the St. Louis, Missouri, resident transformed himself from overweight teen to muscular man. "I'm not saying 'poor me,' but I went through a lot of pain and terrible days," D'Angelo said. "I do believe that if my story can help others, then I'll do what it takes." More than 17 percent of youths ages 12 to 19 were estimated to be obese after a 2003-2006 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study. When D'Angelo was 17, he decided to get in shape. He says he even got a shirtless photo of himself showcased in Cosmopolitan magazine. Watch iReporters 'dancasize' and show off fun workouts Â»

"I was just scared to death of being tested or compared. Boot camps and other group activities provide the camaraderie he craves. Wii Fit and Dance Dance Revolution stations are available. D'Angelo also said he feels he would have benefited from more-structured eating habits and routines as a child. Whether exercise or nutrition are more responsible for increases in obesity over the last 30 years is unclear, Fulton said, but people seeking to lose weight should focus on both areas and pay attention to what they eat.
