A Dutch couple kidnapped in Yemen last month pleaded for help in a video released on Monday. "We have been kidnapped here in Yemen and we have a big problem," said the woman in 90-second video posted online. A spokeswoman for the Dutch Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, released a statement saying: "The Foreign minister announced on the Ministry's Facebook page that the government is concerned about the safety of the citizens. The families of the abductees have been contacted."
