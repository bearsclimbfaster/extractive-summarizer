Not every athlete gets to train with their heroes, but Jennifer Pinches is lucky enough to be friends with one of hers. The 17-year-old is one of the Britain's most promising gymnasts, and she is hoping to line up at her home Olympics this year with Beth Tweddle -- the first competitor from the UK to win a medal at the sport's world championships. It's really good to have that relationship with Beth," Pinches told CNN's Human to Hero series. Pinches has made a good start in her bid to emulate her hero, having been crowned English junior champion in 2007 before representing Britain at the 2011 World Artistic Gymnastic Championships in Tokyo, Japan. She says representing her country at London 2012 would be "the biggest honor." Early days

Born in a small town south of Manchester, Pinches' love for gymnastics blossomed at an early age, and she worked her way up to become English champion in 2007 when she was 13. Now aged 27, Tweddle made history for British gymnastics when she won a bronze medal at the 2003 world championships, and repeated that feat two years later.
