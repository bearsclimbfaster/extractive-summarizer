Former New York Congressman Anthony Weiner is hoping to open a restaurant and create jobs, a year after his failed bid to become the city's next mayor. The Rockaway Restoration Kitchen is still in the planning phases, but part of its stated mission is to aid the unemployed residents of Rockaway, Queens, a neighborhood that was devastated by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. In its current state, Rockaway is a "food desert" according to Weiner, with pizzerias and other fast food joints dominating the landscape.
