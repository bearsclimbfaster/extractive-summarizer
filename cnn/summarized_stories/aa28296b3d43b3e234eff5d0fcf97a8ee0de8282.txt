Where Katy Perry needed a big cat, the New England Patriots were carried to a stunning comeback by the resilience of Tom Brady. The 37-year-old, sacked and twice intercepted, refused to give in as the Patriots -- at one point down by 10 -- fought their way to a 28-24 victory over the Seattle Seahawks in Glendale, Arizona. They were helped by one of the less likely calls in football history, as Seattle threw a second consecutive Super Bowl title into the hands of Malcolm Butler. Patriots rookie Butler made a game-saving interception when the Seahawks, with the ball on the one-yard line and seconds to play, mysteriously chose to pass after an improbable, juggling miracle-catch by Jermaine Kearse. That moment gave Brady and coach Bill Belichick a fourth Super Bowl victory, a feat matched by only two other quarterbacks: Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw. MVP Brady said: "This has been a long journey. I've been at it for 15 years. Malcolm, what a play. "We are the epitome of what Boston is all about."
