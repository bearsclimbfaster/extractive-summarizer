One of those still missing is Yaeko Taguchi, who disappeared from Tokyo on June 12, 1978. The 22-year-old divorced single mother was working nights as a hostess at Tokyo's Cabaret Hollywood, which remains open 36 years later. "When (Taguchi) disappeared, we thought she just quit and left," says general manager Sueji Kikuchi, who has worked there for over 50 years. At the time, Kikuchi didn't know that North Korean operatives were canvassing the cabaret, a fact police later disclosed to Taguchi's older brother, Shigeo Iizuka. They never mentioned Taguchi.
