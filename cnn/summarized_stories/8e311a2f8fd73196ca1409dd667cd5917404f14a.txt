Michael Matz has spent a lifetime working with horses -- first as a member of the U.S. showjumping team that won the silver medal at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and more recently as a trainer of racehorses. But he will always be remembered for just one: Barbaro. The bay colt with the white star on his forehead and bullet-like speed captured the hearts of the American public when he won the Kentucky Derby by seven lengths in 2006 -- but then dramatically broke down in the Preakness Stakes, the second leg of thoroughbred racing's Triple Crown. "I think he had that presence about him," says Matz, his eyes tearing up as he remembers the popular champion. Those who were at Kentucky's Churchill Downs that May day in 2006 would have been forgiven for thinking that they had just witnessed the second coming of 1973 Triple Crown winner Secretariat as Barbaro took control of the race coming off the last bend. "And here comes Barbaro!" But then Barbaro did something he had never done before.
