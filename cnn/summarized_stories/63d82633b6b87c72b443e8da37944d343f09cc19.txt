It's a special thing when a childhood idol does indeed turn out to be a real-life hero. Many students and adults responded with courage Wednesday morning when a 16-year-old sophomore allegedly attacked classmates with two knives at a suburban Pittsburgh high school. But only one person managed to stop the horrific ordeal: Sam King. The Franklin Regional Senior High School assistant principal tackled the alleged assailant to the ground to end five gory, terrifying minutes inside his school, said Murrysville, Pennsylvania, police Chief Thomas Seefeld. "Mr. King has always been like a storybook hero, ever since we were little," former student Challon Fisher wrote on Twitter. Added Julia Bolkovac, who graduated from the school last year: "If there was one guy in the school who I thought would do that, it would be him." Three others -- a school security guard, Assistant Principal Joan Mellon and patrolman William "Buzz" Yakshe, working as the school resource officer -- also played a part in subduing the suspect, identified as Alex Hribal.
