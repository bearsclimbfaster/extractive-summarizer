Eulalia Barrientos spent the last four months in a detention cell in New Jersey. After being apprehended by agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement in June, the illegal immigrant was just steps away from being deported back to her native Guatemala. Barrientos has been granted a one-year stay of removal; after the year, she'll have to go before an immigration judge and plead her case as to why she should be given a green card and allowed to remain in the United States permanently. There's no explanation for what melted ICE. All ICE officials will say is that this was a result of "prosecutorial discretion." It might have something to do with the call I made this week to an ICE representative to ask about the case or the story that the Spanish-language television network NBC-Telemundo did on Barrientos or the fact that New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez took an interest in the fate of a woman who has resided in Newark for nearly 20 years or the fact that, according to Johnson, there may even be a congressional inquiry into whether Barrientos should have been taken into custody in the first place. Barrientos didn't have either on her side. Oh, and a memo.
