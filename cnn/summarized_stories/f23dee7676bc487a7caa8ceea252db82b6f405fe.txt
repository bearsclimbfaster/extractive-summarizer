Sorry seems to be the hardest word. The latest Ferguson confrontation isn't taking place on the streets of the beleaguered city, but between the St. Louis County Police Department and the St. Louis Rams football team -- over an apology, or lack thereof. The brouhaha started silently when five Rams players took to the field Sunday with their palms in the air -- showing the "hands up, don't shoot" gesture used by protesters decrying the police shooting death of unarmed black teen Michael Brown. The St. Louis Police Officers Association was furious, saying the players "chose to ignore the mountains of evidence released from the St. Louis County Grand Jury" after the jurors decided not to indict former Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson. A Rams official spoke with police Monday. St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar sent an e-mail to his staff saying the Rams' chief operating officer called him Monday to apologize. "I received a very nice call this morning from Mr. Kevin Demoff of the St. Louis Rams who wanted to take the opportunity to apologize to our department on behalf of the Rams for the "Hands Up" gesture that some players took the field with yesterday," Belmar wrote in the e-mail, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. The team issued a statement saying the organization had "positive discussions" Monday with Belmar and other police officials "during which we expressed our respect for their concerns surrounding yesterday's game."
