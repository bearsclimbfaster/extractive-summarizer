A young girl bravely stood to ask the Dalai Lama's doctor a question, and he gave her an unusual answer. Dr. Tsewang Tamdin, a world-renowned expert in Tibetan medicine, visited Emory University in Atlanta on Monday as part of his effort to reach more American medical practitioners. He wants to develop collaborative projects between the Tibetan medicine system, which is more than 2,500 years old, and Western medicine. The little girl told Tamdin she suffered from asthma. She wanted to know if there was anything in Tibetan medicine that could help her get better. Tamdin, who spoke through a translator for the hourlong lecture, immediately switched to English. Tibetan medical practice, he explained, ultimately aims to get to the root cause of the problem. "While others might consider the holistic practice of Tibetan medicine 'alternative medicine' or a kind of side practice, I would like for others outside of our system to consider the Tibetan healing system full-fledged healing," Tamdin said. Tibetan practice teaches that people get sick when a person's physical, psychological and spiritual well-being are out of balance. To restore balance, Tamdin recommended diet and exercise changes for the girl. American and Tibetan doctors have some practices in common. "If you think about this, it makes sense," Negi said.
