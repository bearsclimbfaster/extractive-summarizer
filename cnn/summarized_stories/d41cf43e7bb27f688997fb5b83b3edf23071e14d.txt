The Florida judge presiding over George Zimmerman's murder trial ruled Monday that jurors will be allowed to hear about marijuana found in Trayvon Martin's system the night he was fatally shot. Prosecutors argued the amount was so minimal that "we just don't know" what effect it had on Martin. But the defense said the amount found in Martin's system would have affected his judgment that night and is therefore relevant to the case. Judge Debra Nelson ruled she would allow the testimony about Martin's toxicology results in front of the jury and told the prosecutors they would be able to cross-examine the defense's witness and present rebuttal witnesses of their own. Zimmerman is charged with second-degree murder for killing 17-year-old Martin in Sanford, Florida, on February 26, 2012. Zimmerman told police he was pursuing the teenager because there had been a rash of crime in the area. A confrontation ensued, and Zimmerman said he was forced to kill Martin. Protests were held around the country, calling for Zimmerman's arrest in Martin's death. Zimmerman was eventually charged with second-degree murder in April 2012. Trayvon Martin's father, Tracy, took the stand on Monday to describe what he heard in the background of a 911 call made by one of Zimmerman's neighbor. Earlier in the day, the defense called the former lead investigator from the Sanford Police Department, Chris Serino, who said Martin told him "no," under his breath, when asked if the voice belonged to his son.
