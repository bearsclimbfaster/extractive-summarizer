Gore Vidal was a man of immense literary talent, some of which he used well, some of which he wasted. The more widely read and prize-winning "Lincoln" ruffled Lincoln scholars and many Americans, who objected to Vidal's depiction of our 16th president as a ruthless proto-fascist intent on crushing the South and transforming the small government American republic into a version of Bismark's Germany. But Vidal loved to be a polemicist and he valued imagination and vision, especially his own, more than he valued fact. Love was not a feature of human life that he had much interest in or sympathy for. Shy is the wrong word. He was not shy about anything. I got to know Gore Vidal quite well, up front and personal, his magnificent strengths and his appalling, almost other-worldly weaknesses. One day in the mid-1990s I got a call from Vidal's literary executor, asking if I would be interested in writing his biography. The idea excited me. Gore had looked at my bios of Dickens and Henry James. It was, I suggested, because he lived in Italy. He preferred the attractions of Italy.
