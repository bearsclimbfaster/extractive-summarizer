The Spanish champions, held 0-0 at home by Sevilla at the weekend, once again found goals hard to come by against their struggling opponents. In injury time, Granada's Daniel Benitez was also red carded after being cautioned for a second time. But Alessandro Matri grabbed the winner as Juve kept up their unbeaten start to the season.
