The government of Lebanon cried out to the world for help Monday over the strain the civil war in neighboring Syria is putting on its country. The exodus of people fleeing lives and homes ripped apart by bombs and bullets for the safety of Lebanon does not want to abate. And the coffers are nearly empty. Next year's budget is only 5% funded so far, the United Nations says. The U.N. said Monday that $6.5 billion, a record amount, will be needed next year to cover a projected 4 million Syrian civil war refugees and the communities they have flooded into.
