The top prosecutors in Mexico and Guatemala set their sights on the Zetas drug cartel Wednesday, pledging to pool information and resources as their countries battle the notoriously violent criminal group. Attorneys general from the neighboring nations agreed "to create concrete mechanisms for quickly exchanging timely information for the fight against the Zetas organization and others," Mexico's Attorney General's Office said in a statement. The top prosecutors met a day after Guatemalan authorities announced a monthlong extension of the "state of siege" in the northern border province of Peten -- a move aimed at continuing a crackdown on organized crime in the area. Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom declared the emergency measure in May after investigators found the bodies of 27 dismembered and decapitated workers on a farm in Peten.
