Socks, the cat who won international fame during his years in the Clinton White House, was euthanized Friday after months of treatment for cancer. Socks was adopted by Chelsea Clinton when her father was governor of Arkansas. Socks, who was born in 1989, was put to sleep about 10 a.m. at Three Notch Veterinary Clinic in Hollywood, Maryland, said veterinary assistant Rae Dera.
