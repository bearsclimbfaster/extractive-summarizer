But the weights were slipping. The gym was silent. Everyone was impressed. But the thing I noticed most as he strutted around gasping for air was his Penn State University T-shirt. "That's how we do. We are Penn State." It was the first time since 2011, when the horrific Jerry Sandusky child abuse scandal was revealed, that I felt any pride or connection to my alma mater. In 2012, Sandusky, the former assistant football coach, was sentenced to 30-60 years in prison for the sexual abuse of 10 boys after tearful testimony from his victims. And when my son was accepted to Penn State that year, we tossed the acceptance letter in the trash. I am a Nittany Lion and I was ashamed. Sadly, my new-found pride was short-lived. The NCAA caved, ruling last week to restore Penn State's 112 wins wiped out during the Sandusky scandal, including the 111 wins erased from the record of head football coach Joe Paterno -- all the victories after the first time police were called by a mother reporting that Sandusky had showered with her 10-year-old son on the Penn State campus back in 1998.
