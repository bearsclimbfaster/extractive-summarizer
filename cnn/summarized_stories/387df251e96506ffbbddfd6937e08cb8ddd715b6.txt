Never. It's just good common sense. But not for the local film crew I was working with in China's Hengdian Studios. To power the lights for an episode of CNN's "On China," a locally hired grip tied a rope to the end of a cable. Movie-making in China is not for the timid -- something I learned both behind the scenes and while talking to some of China's leading movie-makers in Hengdian, home of the world's largest outdoor film studio.

Sprawling across some 2,500 acres with a full replica of the Forbidden City, Hengdian World Studios is where Zhang Yimou's "Hero" was filmed as well as countless TV dramas for the Mainland market. It's also where grips like to take short cuts with cables, and makeup artists do touch-ups with dirty brushes. Movie-making in China is a quick and dirty business, a process director Eva Jin affectionately calls "China Speed." Her 2009 romantic comedy starring Zhang Ziyi, "Sophie's Revenge," earned 100 million RMB ($16 million) at the box office, making her China's first female director to break that symbolic barrier. "The process in Hollywood is so slow," Jin says.
