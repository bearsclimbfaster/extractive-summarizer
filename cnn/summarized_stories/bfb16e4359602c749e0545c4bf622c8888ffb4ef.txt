The former head of intelligence of Guinea Bissau was shot dead in the capital late Sunday, hours after the peaceful conclusion of the country's presidential elections. Col. Samba Djalo was shot seven times, officials said. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, and authorities did not have a motive, said Interior Minister Fernando Gomes.
