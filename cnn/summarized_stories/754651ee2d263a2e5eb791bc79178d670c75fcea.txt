So, when Austin Reed Sigg was arrested Tuesday night, accused of strangling 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway, dismembering her and placing her body parts under the two-story home where he lived, many of the girls in that Denver suburb weren't shocked. "He was so infatuated with the idea of death," Hannah Bane, a college classmate, told a local reporter. Detectives spent a bitter-cold Wednesday at Sigg's home in Westminster as crime scene technicians gathered more evidence in the gruesome case. They said they found parts of Jessica's body stuffed in a crawlspace under the home. The bespectacled blonde girl disappeared October 5 while walking to Witt Elementary School. The big break came Tuesday night, when Sigg's mother called 911 and handed him the phone. Sigg, police said, confessed. But Christie Mueller wasn't one of them. She had bumped into Sigg, 17, twice on an isolated trail in the city.
