A judge on Tuesday refused to throw out a case filed by four cast members from the hit 1970s television show "Happy Days," who are suing to recover money from merchandise they claimed they have never received. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Elizabeth Allen White denied a motion by CBS for a summary judgment, which would have ended the lawsuit. CBS owns the show. White ruled that that "defendants have not met their initial burden of showing that plaintiffs are not entitled to merchandising royalties for the use of their likeness on DVD sets sold to consumers." "The Court emphasizes that it is not making a determination on the merits of (CBS') claim, which might be proven at trial, but only that defendants have not met their initial burden" for the purpose of ending the lawsuit, White wrote. Four members of the cast, Marion Ross, Don Most, Anson Williams and Erin Moran, along with the widow of Tom Bosley, sued CBS in April 2011, claiming they have not been been paid what they're owed for the worldwide sale of "Happy Days" merchandise. Bosley died in 2010.
