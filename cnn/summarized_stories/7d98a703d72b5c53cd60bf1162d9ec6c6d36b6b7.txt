Police in Afghanistan say they have rescued a 15-year-old girl who was locked up in the basement of her in-laws' house, starved and had her nails pulled out. But, they said, they were waiting for her to fully recover to talk to her and learn more. And she said with broken voice that her husband used to cut her flesh using pliers," Basharat said. "She was in a very bad condition when I met her," Zarifi said.
