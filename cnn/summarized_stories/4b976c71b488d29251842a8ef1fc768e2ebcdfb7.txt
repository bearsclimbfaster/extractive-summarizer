Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale first ran down soldier Lee Rigby in a car, then hacked him to death in a frenzied machete and knife attack. Confronted with gory closed-circuit TV footage, grueling witness testimony and Adebolajo's own defense that he had "no choice" in Rigby's killing, as he was "a soldier of Allah," the jury took only 90 minutes to convict both defendants of his murder. But what led Adebolajo, 29, and Adebowale, 22, both born and raised in Britain by families of Christian Nigerian origin, to kill on London's streets in the name of Islam? Adebolajo was the only one to give evidence in court. He converted to Islam in 2002 to 2003, while at a university, and adopted an Islamic name, Mujahid Abu Hamza. "I am a soldier of Allah," he told the jury. "It is a war between Islam and those militaries that intervene in Muslim lands." Adebowale, who did not take the stand, converted to Islam more recently, in 2008 to 2009. In a news briefing, Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick said police had had contact with the two men, as both victims and offenders, over a number of years -- in Adebowale's case for drug offenses, and in Adebolajo's case for a handful of incidents involving violent crime. Both were at a demonstration in 2006 outside the Old Bailey in London. Adebolajo was subsequently convicted on two counts of assaulting a police officer and spent 51 days in prison, but Adebowale was not arrested. Adebolajo still pleads innocence in that case, denying he punched a female officer in the face and a male officer in the groin. I did it for my God.
