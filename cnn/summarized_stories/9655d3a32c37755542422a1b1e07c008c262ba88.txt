Israel's top general said Iran is led by "very rational people" and doesn't appear poised to build a nuclear bomb that would threaten his nation. Iran "is going step by step to the place where it will be able to decide whether to manufacture a nuclear bomb," Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Benny Gantz told Israel's Haaretz newspaper in Wednesday editions. "They were spinning before the talks began recently with Iran, they were spinning during the talks, they're spinning as we speak." Iran maintains it is not planning to build a bomb.
