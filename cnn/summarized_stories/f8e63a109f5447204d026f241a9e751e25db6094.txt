Indian border guards fired four rockets into Pakistan on Saturday in what they said was retaliation to a similar fire from the other side. Pakistan denied that claim. Two unexploded rockets were traced after midnight near an Indian outpost along the border dividing the Punjab region between the two countries, said K. Srinivasan, a deputy inspector-general of India's Border Security Force.
