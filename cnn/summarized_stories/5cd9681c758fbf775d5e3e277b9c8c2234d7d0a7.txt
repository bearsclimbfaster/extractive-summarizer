Any baseball fan who has been alive in the last decade is familiar with a truism: "That's just Manny being Manny." It has been used to describe one of the best outfielders in baseball history, Manny Ramirez, who -- like a certain Vice President -- had a way of stumbling into (and creating) some truly terrible press. He could be endearing, running an American flag out onto the field with a wide boyish smile after becoming a U.S. citizen. And occasionally, Ramirez was a legitimate problem: shoving aging traveling secretary Jack McCormick over a ticket request, faking injuries to get out of key games, violating the league's drug policy and blasting his own team in the media. After criticizing key Arab allies in our fragile anti-ISIS coalition -- including Turkey, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia at a time when muscling the resolve to go after the terrorist fighters in Syria and Iraq is a heavy lift for everyone involved -- Biden's "gaffe" is one that could come with significant consequences.
