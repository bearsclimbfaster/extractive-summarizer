Like many other Yemenis, I was overwhelmed by the news of the Life March which was set off from Freedom Square in Taiz late December 2011. The youth used the term Life March to denote a continuation of their revolutionary protest and a rejection of the immunity given to President Ali Abdullah Saleh. They wanted the whole international community to notice that what is happening in Yemen is in fact a revolution, not just a political crisis. In this spirit, they wanted the world to seriously consider their demands to topple Saleh's regime completely and start building the civil and democratic country they all aspire to have. It was not unrealistic that thugs and snipers loyal to Saleh could inflict heavy casualties on the marchers. However, the marchers slowly shed these concerns as they climbed the mountainous roads along the cities of Ibb and Dhamar on their way to Sana'a.
