Fernando Torres rediscovered his scoring touch as Liverpool continued their revival under new owners with a 2-0 win over English Premier League leaders Chelsea at Anfield on Sunday. The Spanish star scored two magnificent first half goals to seal three points for Roy Hodgson's men. The first came after 11 minutes as he instantly controlled a Dirk Kuyt through ball before beating Petr Cech with a low shot. Home keeper Pepe Reina blocked a close range shot from Florent Malouda after a cross by Droga. You can't have success if you don't have front players who do a good job for you," he told Sky Sports.
