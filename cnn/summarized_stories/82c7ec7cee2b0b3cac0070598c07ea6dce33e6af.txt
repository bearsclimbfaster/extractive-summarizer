Trayvon Martin's father, Tracy, said Thursday it was difficult to listen to testimony about his son, particularly the negative comments, during George Zimmerman's trial. "That wasn't the Trayvon that we raised. That wasn't the Trayvon that we knew, and that we love," he said during a Thursday night interview on CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360." Still, Trayvon Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, said that she felt the need to sit through every day of Zimmerman's trial because her son was "not here to say anything for himself." Martin's parents spoke out Thursday for the first time since Zimmerman was acquitted in the death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman could still be held responsible

"It came as a complete shock for me," Fulton said about the verdict. "And the reason I say that is because I just look at people as people, and I thought for sure that the jury looked at Trayvon as an average teenager that was minding his own business, that wasn't committing any crime." Martin's parents opted not to be in the courtroom when the verdict was read. "When I heard the verdict, I kind of understand the disconnect," Fulton said. "Maybe they (jurors) didn't see Trayvon as their son. It didn't work for us'

Tracy Martin said he wasn't concerned about the racial makeup of the jury before the start of the trial, which has become a forum for debate about gun laws and race in America. The juror gave an exclusive interview to CNN's Anderson Cooper this week and said the jury felt like it knew Zimmerman but didn't know enough about Martin.
