Posts on his Facebook page rail against religion. But was that the motive of a gunman who allegedly killed three Muslim students in Chapel Hill, North Carolina? As thousands of mourners joined funeral prayers for the three victims, conflicting details emerged about the suspect, 46-year-old Craig Hicks. Karen Hicks told CNN affiliate WTVD, something inside his head must have snapped before the shooting. Neighbors told reporters that Craig Hicks was known for angrily confronting people over everything from loud music to parking issues in the area. "We have no doubt that the way they looked and the way they believed had something to do with this," said Mohammad Abu-Salha, whose two daughters were killed in the shooting. A Facebook page that is believed to belong to Hicks includes many posts that are critical of religion, particularly Christianity. The page describes Craig Hicks as an atheist and an anti-theist. Anti-theists are a particularly outspoken group of atheists who can be confrontational about their disbelief, researchers at University of Tennessee at Chattanooga said in a recent study. He often champions on his Facebook page for the rights of many individuals, for same-sex marriages, abortion, race. There are photos of Craig and Karen Hicks together at Disney World, and a photo of him riding an all-terrain vehicle in the woods.
