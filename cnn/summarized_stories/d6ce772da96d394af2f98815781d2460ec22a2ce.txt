Aya Abu Mouwais, a 3-year-old who lives in the West Bank, can barely walk or talk because of a failing kidney and liver. Thankfully, an Israeli man has been able to help her get the treatment she so desperately requires. More than 500 times in the past two years, Yuval Roth and his volunteers have driven Aya and her mother roundtrip from a checkpoint near the West Bank border to Rambam Medical Center, which is an hour away in Haifa, Israel. "What Yuval has done, no one else has done," said Aya's mother, Suhair. I'm not allowed to drive an Israeli car, so if not for Yuval, we wouldn't be able to transport her. I thank him." Leaving the West Bank is the only way Aya's family can get dialysis. "In the Palestinian Authority, it's very expensive to get health care, and most of the people cannot afford it," Roth said. Although the Palestinian Authority allows sick children and adults to leave the West Bank for treatment, Palestinians are not allowed to drive past the checkpoints. "The volunteers are driving at least five days a week," said Roth, a 55-year-old carpenter and professional juggler from Pardes Hanna, Israel.
