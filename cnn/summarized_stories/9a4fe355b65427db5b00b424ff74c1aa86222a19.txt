On Wednesday, President Barack Obama officially came out in support of the right of Americans to marry same-sex partners, ending a streak of ambiguity over his position that has long perplexed supporters of marriage equality. "I've just concluded that for me, personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married," Obama told ABC News. His now-evolved statement came one day after North Carolina became the latest Southern state to pass an amendment banning same sex-marriage and domestic partnerships. Obama's campaign issued a statement last month opposing the amendment. But pressure had grown on the White House to go further after Vice President Joe Biden said Sunday, in response to a question on a talk show, that he was "absolutely comfortable" with same sex-marriage. Obama had said only that his position was "evolving" after having once opposed same-sex marriage. On Monday, Education Secretary Arne Duncan also showed support for same-sex marriage. Marriage-equality advocates quickly pounced on the statement, ramping up pressure on Obama to do so as well. "Standing up for the freedom to marry is not just the right thing to do, it's the right thing politically, and it's time for the president to stand on the right side of history," said Evan Wolfson, president of Freedom to Marry, an advocacy group. Opinion: Obama's most courageous moment

"While this president can point to successes in advancing gay civil rights, much more than I think any other president, that final step (of endorsing same-sex marriage) would leave him open to a series of negative attacks that could really alienate swing voters," CNN political contributor John Avlon said Tuesday, before the president made his statement. iReport: What's your take on this issue?
