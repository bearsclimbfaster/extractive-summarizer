A Chinese court on Monday suspended the death sentence of Gu Kailai, the wife of a disgraced Communist Party leader, after finding her guilty of murder in the death of a British businessman, a court official said. Gu's death penalty has been suspended for two years due to her weakened mental capacity while committing the crime and her close cooperation with police during the investigation, according to Tang Yigan, deputy chief of Hefei Intermediate People's Court. "I think this verdict is fair. It fully reflects the court's respect for law, reality and especially human life," Gu said in video from Monday's court session shown on state-run CCTV. Four police officers also were convicted of covering up the murder and received prison sentences ranging from five to eleven years, Tang said. Gu and a former household aide went on trial August 9 on charges of poisoning 41-year-old Neil Heywood. Murder trial at heart of Chinese political scandal

Near the end of that day's court proceedings, she said according to state-run news agency Xinhua that she "accepted all the facts written in the indictment" -- including poisoning the Brit at a time when she thought her son's life was in danger. At the time of Heywood's death last November, Gu's husband Bo Xilai was the head of the Communist party in the bustling southwestern city of Chongqing and an influential and controversial member of the Communist Party's politburo, the elite group of 25 men who run China.

Gu's aide, Zhang Xiaojun, also was found guilty Monday in Heywood's death and sentenced to nine years in prison, Tang said.
