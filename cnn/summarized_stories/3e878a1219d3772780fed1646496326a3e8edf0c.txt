I have spent my scientific career studying oil spills, including the ongoing disaster in the Gulf of Mexico that killed 11 people in the initial rig blast and is causing epic environmental damage, havoc to lives and livelihoods, political tumult, huge economic losses and an incessant media drumbeat. But while we have readily and rightfully committed ourselves to understanding the cause of the spill, its effects and how to help restore the affected Gulf Coast region, we still can't seem to come to grips with a much more dangerous, far-reaching pollutant that is changing the fundamental chemistry of our entire planet: carbon dioxide. Why the difference in concern? Is it as simple as out of sight, out of mind? CNN and other media outlets do not stream figures about carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. Our eyes are riveted to watching the black trail of oil soiling Gulf waters and coastlines.
