Engines rev up Sunday for the start of the 2013 NASCAR season with the 55th running of the Daytona 500, stock car racing's biggest event. The loss of 20 children and six employees at the Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school united people in grief across the globe, many of whom had an immediate desire to help. NASCAR President Mike Helton was among those. Helton, Waltrip and Swan Racing -- the team Waltrip will drive for in Sunday's race -- had a private meeting with Newtown officials, community leaders, first responders and victims' families in early February. At a February 14 event in Daytona Beach, Florida, it was announced that Waltrip's car number 30 would be changed to 26 and his colors would be green and white to honor those lost. There will also be a message on the car, "Text Newtown to 80888," for fans to make a $10 donation to the Sandy Hook School Support Fund, which was established by the United Way of Western Connecticut and Newtown Savings Bank. 15, Mark Martin in No.
