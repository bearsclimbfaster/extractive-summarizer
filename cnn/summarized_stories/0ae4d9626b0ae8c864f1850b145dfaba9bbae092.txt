I thought 'this is it - I'm not coming out of here,'" said earthquake survivor Anne Vos. She was speaking from her hospital bed in Christchurch, New Zealand, after being rescued from the rubble of a five-story building that collapsed during Tuesday's 6.3-magnitude earthquake. Vos had spoken to the media on her mobile phone while trapped under her desk in the Pyne Gould Corporation building, drawing international attention to her plight. In the 24 hours she spent under the rubble, Vos, 57, said she gave up hope, and accepted she would die. "I'm very lucky, I'm very, very lucky," she said. She had taken over at the reception desk to allow a colleague to go for lunch, and she was logging onto a computer when the "rumbling" started. It was then, in severe pain and struggling to breathe, that Vos realized she may not survive. She was unable to reach her Melbourne-based son, Robert, and she left a goodbye message on his voicemail. Some time after those initial calls, Vos says she passed out. Her son, Robert, gave her number to a Melbourne radio station, and soon conversations with her were being broadcast internationally.
