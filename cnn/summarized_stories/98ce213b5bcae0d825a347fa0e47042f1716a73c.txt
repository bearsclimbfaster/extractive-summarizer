The police officer who fatally shot a Hofstra University student as she was being held at gunpoint by an intruder has been cleared of any wrongdoing, according to a report released Wednesday by the Nassau County District Attorney's office in New York. Officer Nikolas Budimlic "reasonably perceived threats of deadly force against himself and others and acted accordingly," the report concluded. The 28-page investigative report, which includes interviews with police officers and civilian witnesses, as well as forensic evidence, was ordered by District Attorney Kathleen M. Rice after Budimlic opened fire and killed both the armed home intruder and the student in May. The intruder, Delton Smith, 30, was fatally shot seven times by Budimlic, according to the report. She later died of her injuries at Nassau University Medical Center, the report said.
