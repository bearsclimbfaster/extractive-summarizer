Between my 17th and 19th birthday, I went from overweight teenager to lean adult by losing 99 pounds. I was a happy teenager from a loving family. Food never served as a substitute for happiness in my life, and I had no reason for comfort eating. Well, that's not totally true. He loved bread with some bacon; I preferred a lot of bacon with some bread. It's as simple as that. When you're fat, you're a target. I would still be extremely obese right now if it wasn't for a school trip to Paris in 2005. I realized that sometimes you have to RSVP yes when life sends you an invitation for change. (If I had known I would eventually be writing a weight loss story for CNN, I would have gone for 100). Luckily, I've never encountered the dreaded yo-yo effect.
