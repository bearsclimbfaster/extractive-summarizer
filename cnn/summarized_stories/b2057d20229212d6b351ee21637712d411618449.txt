In a job where I'm seeking innovations that allow more families to have better access to fresh fruits and vegetables, I'm struck that advocates seem mostly interested in mapping and remapping the same neighborhoods to establish conclusive proof that food deserts exist. By the USDA definition, that means documenting "a census tract with a substantial share of residents who live in low-income areas that have low levels of access to a grocery store or healthy, affordable food retail outlet." It's as if doctors kept perfecting the test for polio without looking for a vaccine. To buy the critics' argument means you have to believe a mother would put her family in life-threatening situations, endure the suffering associated with hunger, opt out of the American Dream, all to get about $4.50 a day in federal food assistance. On top of everything else, as economist Jacob Geller and others have pointed out, the government's food desert definition might not matter much. Food builds community and helps reduce social isolation. What we need is a Food Oasis Movement. Also, price matters. In California, Oakland's People's Grocery created a mobile market and a farm-to-table distribution business serving low-income families. In Maryland, Baltimore's virtual supermarket allows residents to order healthy food and pick up their deliveries at neighborhood libraries, schools and senior housing sites. In Atlanta, across the street from the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site, Rashid Nuri turned a neglected property into a six-acre farm, Wheat Street Garden, with an on-site market. Guess what?
