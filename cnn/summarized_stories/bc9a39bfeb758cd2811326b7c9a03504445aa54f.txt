The United Nations nuclear monitors plan to return to Iran at the end of the month after a positive assessment from both sides of the latest visit. An International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) team spent three days in Tehran this week. Another meeting is planned for February 21-22. "The agency is committed to intensifying dialogue," said Director General Yukiya Amano.
