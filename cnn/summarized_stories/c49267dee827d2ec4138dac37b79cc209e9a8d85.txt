Many Americans recall the image of Barack Obama standing on the steps of the Capitol as he was sworn in as the 44th president of the United States in 2009. But they also remember Aretha Franklin, and how she belted out "My Country, 'Tis of Thee" wearing an enormous bow that threatened to engulf her entire head. Later that night, Beyonce crooned "At Last" while the Obamas took their first spin on the dance floor as POTUS and FLOTUS. This time, Beyonce will perform the national anthem, with Kelly Clarkson singing "My Country, 'Tis of Thee" and James Taylor doing the honors on "America the Beautiful." Inaugural events have spotlighted the intersection of politics, pop culture and music since the early '60s, said David Gergen, director of the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard University. "The person that really changed the nature of inaugural music was John Kennedy, because he was a friend with many in Hollywood -- especially Frank Sinatra," said Gergen, also a CNN contributor. "So Kennedy, you have it. Nixon, you don't." At Richard Nixon's first inauguration in 1969, the crowd was treated to "This is My Country" performed by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir of Salt Lake City, according to the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies.
