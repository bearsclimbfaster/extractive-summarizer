The mascot for the 2012 European soccer championship co-hosted by Poland and Ukraine has been officially unveiled: a pair of footballing brothers wearing the jerseys of each nation. Critics might say that UEFA and its design company Warner Bros. have hardly displayed originality, because the mascot for Euro 2008, co-hosted by Austria and Switzerland, was twin brothers "Trix and Flix." But love them or hate them, the spiky-haired pair will doubtless make a small fortune in memorabilia and associated sales for the 2012 organizers and Europe's ruling body. The use and marketing of commercially-designed mascots at major football competitions began in 1966 for the World Cup held in England, who beat West Germany 4-2 in the final. Flushed by that success, the "World Cup Willie" mascot proved an immediate hit and helped swell the coffers of the English Football Association, so it was inevitable that the innovation was here to stay. World Cup Willie (1966 World Cup, England)

The first, and some people say, best of all football mascots, although the choice of United Kingdom red, white and blue for the lion's outfit, when the tournament was hosted by England alone, was in retrospect a strange decision. 2. Tip and Tap (1974 World Cup, Germany)

The 1974 hosts kitted out two boys in the white shirts of the national team, emblazoned with the initials WM (Weltermeisterschaft) -- which is German for World Cup.
