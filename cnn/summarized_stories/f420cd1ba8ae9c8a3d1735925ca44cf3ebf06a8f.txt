For months, the rebels fighting to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad were considered by the global community to be unorganized. And now France and the United Kingdom are giving help to those rebels and their unified opposition organization. Though the United States has not made any kind of statement, France's and the United Kingdom's declarations of support could mark major progress toward international intervention and, perhaps in turn, an end to the fighting that has killed more than 37,000 people since March 2011. The Assad family has controlled Syria for four decades. On Tuesday, for example, government-controlled SANA news agency reported that "terrorists" shelled a publishing outlet in Damascus. British Foreign Secretary William Hague told members of parliament Tuesday that the National Coalition of the Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces was the "sole legitimate representative" of the Syrian people, calling it a "credible" alternative to al-Assad.
