American Lindsey Vonn suffered a pre-Olympic scare after taking a crashing fall in the World Cup giant slalom in Lienz on Monday. "Hurting my arm is way better than hurting one of my legs," Vonn was quoted on her personal Web site www.lindseyvonn.com. Taina Barioz of France occupied the final podium position.
