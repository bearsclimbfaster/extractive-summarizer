The two U.S. journalists released from North Korea last month after five months in captivity said "the psychological wounds of imprisonment are slow to heal." Freed U.S. journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee said they spent less than a minute on North Korean soil. In a column posted on the Los Angeles Times Web site Tuesday night, Laura Ling and Euna Lee also said they were seized by North Korean soldiers on Chinese soil. Working for California-based Current TV, a media venture of Vice President Al Gore, the two journalists were arrested in March after stepping on North Korean soil. They were sentenced to 12 years of hard labor and eventually pardoned by North Korean leader Kim Jong Il after he met with President Clinton early in August. A producer, Mitch Koss, was also with them. Instinctively, we ran.
