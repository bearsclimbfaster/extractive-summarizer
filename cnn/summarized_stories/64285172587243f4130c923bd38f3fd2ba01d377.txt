Arsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho's uneasy relationship hit a new low as their ugly managerial spat overshadowed Chelsea's 2-0 win over Arsenal Sunday to extend its lead at the top of the English Premier League. The pair squared up to each other and had to be separated by the fourth official after Wenger shoved Mourinho in the Chelsea technical area. The Arsenal boss was angered by Gary Cahill's challenge on Alexis Sanchez but the pair's seething rivalry has been a constant theme in the English football soap opera. Back in March, Mourinho labeled Wenger a "specialist in failure" and then his side rubbed salt into the open wound by thrashing Arsenal 6-0. Arsenal was always a factor in a closely-fought match at Stamford Bridge and might have had a penalty when former player Cesc Fabregas appeared to block Jack Wilshere's shot in the area in the second half. His pinpoint pass, his seventh assist in the EPL this season, left Costa to score his ninth in seven games since moving from Atletico Madrid, another key Mourinho signing.
