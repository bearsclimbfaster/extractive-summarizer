First, you may be dazzled by her gentle smile. Am I sitting across a true leading woman or is her big brother actually calling the shots? At Government House in Thailand, I recently interviewed Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra -- a woman who has heard those questions -- and more -- before. She is Thailand's elected leader, the country's first female Prime Minister, and -- as I found out -- ready to fire back at her critics and defend her authority. "You have a lot of key stakeholders," Yingluck tells me. She has raised the country's minimum wage, helped pass a massive loan bill to overhaul Thailand's transportation infrastructure, and also become the country's first female defense minister -- a position she says she is uniquely qualified to handle because she is a woman. Cue that dazzling smile.
