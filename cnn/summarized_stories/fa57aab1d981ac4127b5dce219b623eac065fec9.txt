Based on profits, Sony Corp. is an outstanding company -- in life insurance sales and hit movies such as the "Men in Black" and "Spider-Man" franchises. But in the industry where Sony made its name -- consumer electronics -- the company needs a lifeline as it finishes its fiscal year with a record $6.4 billion loss. New CEO Kazuo Hirai, who took the helm on April 1, promised Thursday to cut 10,000 jobs -- about 6% of its workforce -- in the next year. Moreover, Hirai is refocusing the business away from its once mighty television division to focus on the core businesses of digital imaging, game and mobile products. "Our entertainment and financial services are poised for future growth," Hirai said. We must tackle it head-on." "Now is the time for Sony to change," he declared, a refrain throughout the hour-long press conference. Natural disasters hit balance sheets, with record floods in Thailand -- a center for offshore electronics production -- doing as much financial damage as the 2011 Tohoku quake and tsunami for some Japanese firms.
