After the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, hundreds of thousands of cards, letters, drawings, stuffed animals and other sentimental items poured into Newtown from throughout the world in a show of support. Newtown resident Yolie Moreno said Friday that she plans a unique way to turn those sentiments into the actual building blocks of a future memorial. Moreno started an initiative called Embracing Newtown which will make use of the massive amounts of material that turned up starting in January at the town's municipal center. The items were incinerated, with the ashes, or what Moreno called "sacred soil," to be used in the making of bricks to serve as the foundation of a future memorial honoring the 26 who lost their lives. That's my goal."
