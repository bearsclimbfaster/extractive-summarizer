June 12  Presidential elections are held following a campaign that saw huge rallies held in support of both incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and main opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi, suggesting the race would be closely fought. Incumbent Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad casts his vote in Tehran last week. June 13  Moussavi calls for vote counting to stop, saying there are "blatant violations." The government says Ahmadinejad won the ballot with 62.63 percent of the vote, while Moussavi received 33.75 percent of the vote. Following the announcement, angry crowds in Iran's capital break into shops, tear down signs and start fires as they protest the re-election of Ahmadinejad. June 14 Ahmadinejad gives victory speech, declines to guarantee the safety of Moussavi. He is welcomed as the "newly re-elected president of Iran." Rally passes without violence.
