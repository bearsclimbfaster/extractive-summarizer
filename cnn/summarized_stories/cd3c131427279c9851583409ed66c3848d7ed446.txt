Now Cheyenne Woods is embarking on her quest to dominate the world of women's golf just like Tiger did in the men's arena. The 21-year-old has signed with the same Excel agency that represents Tiger and announced her intention to turn professional after excelling in the amateur ranks. "As I begin my professional career, I am confident and excited about working with Excel as they help shape my future, both personally and professionally." She was a two-time All-American and three-time All-Atlantic Coast Conference team member.
