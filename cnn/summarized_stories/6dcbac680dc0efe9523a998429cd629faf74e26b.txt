Merle and Pat Butler, lifetime residents of Red Bud, Illinois, hold the third winning ticket worth $218 million in last month's Mega Millions lottery, officials announced Wednesday. The retired couple came forward in their hometown's City Hall on Wednesday after spending the past two weeks hiring "real good financial advisers" and a lawyer to help them manage their new fortune: $158 million after taxes. "Instead of thinking of things we could spend it on, we've been thinking of ways to invest it," Merle Butler, 65, said Wednesday. Pat Butler, 62, said that keeping their secret was easier because they've been out of town most of the time since they won. "I was retired, and it looks like I've got another full-time job," Merle Butler said. He realized they won as he watched the 10 o'clock news March 30, soon after the drawing. The Butlers decided to keep it a secret. "I figured the quieter I keep it, the better we are to get it set up and get it going before we did the claim," Merle Butler said. It may have helped that it was April Fools weekend when he was confronted at the local bank, where he went there to put the ticket in their lock box. Guessing who held the ticket was the community obsession for the past 18 days in Red Bud, according to Denise Metzger, manager of the Moto Mart convenience store where the winning ticket was sold.
