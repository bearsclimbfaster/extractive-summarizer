Growing up near the South Side of Chicago, a good portion of my youth was spent on the fields or on the courts. (It didn't hurt that Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls were in pursuit of their six NBA championships at the time.) Get fit and others will follow

After high school, my fitness levels began to decline. Besides my poor eating habits, I attribute this to one factor: I'd been benched. My access to team sports was dwindling, and there was an extreme unlikelihood that the NFL and NBA would be knocking on my door any time soon. Daily practices and games were replaced by long work hours, dinner out with friends and nights in front of the TV. (Not that I complained.)
