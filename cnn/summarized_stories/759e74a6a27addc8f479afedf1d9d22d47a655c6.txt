A dramatic confrontation in Hong Kong between Michael Bay's film crew and men who wanted money might be better set in a Jackie Chan movie. The street vendors allegedly became violent when Bay refused to quadruple the payment they would get for the disruption caused by filming for the fourth installment in his "Transformers" film franchise. "Yes, some drugged up guys were being belligerent asses to my crew for hours in the morning of our first shoot day in Hong Kong," Bay said in a posting on his website Thursday. Bay, 48, is in Hong Kong filming "Transformers: Age of Extinction" starring Mark Wahlberg and Nicola Peltz, which is due in theaters next June. "Every vendor where we shot got paid a fair price for our inconvenience, but he wanted four times that amount," Bay wrote. The man returned an hour later, "carrying a long air-conditioner unit," according to Bay.
