Federal authorities have filed a civil complaint seeking the forfeiture of a stolen dinosaur skeleton and its return to Mongolia, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. The skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus bataar was looted from Mongolia's Gobi Desert and brought to the United States illegally, the U.S. Attorney's Office and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a joint statement Monday. Cadogan Tate was not immediately available for comment.
