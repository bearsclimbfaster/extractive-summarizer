Actor Brandon T. Jackson was kicked off a US Airways flight Monday because he was disruptive, the airline told CNN Wednesday. The "Tropic Thunder" star claims that it was other passengers who were loud and that the flight attendant who reported him called him the "n-word." "The disruptive behavior started with loud music being played by Mr. Jackson at his seat," the airline said. Additional erratic behavior was observed, and that is when the crew made the decision to stop serving. But Jackson's rep insisted the actor was not served any drinks before the incident, which he said began when Jackson walked to the back of the plane to ask for two sandwiches for himself and a seat mate.
