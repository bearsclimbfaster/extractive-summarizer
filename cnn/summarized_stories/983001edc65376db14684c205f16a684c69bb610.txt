Yet another scale Il Divo has mastered: scaling the heights of success. The operatic quartet's new album, "The Promise," debuted atop the UK charts, their third collection to hit the No. 1 spot. The album (which was released in the U.S. last Tuesday) features Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah," Frankie Goes to Hollywood's "The Power of Love," and the traditional "Amazing Grace." Il Divo also takes a chance on the ABBA hit "The Winner Takes it All." The group is the brainchild of "American Idol" judge Simon Cowell, who saw a potential market for an international, "popera"-style act after the soaring success of the Andrea Bocelli-Sarah Brightman duet "Time to Say Goodbye (Con te Partiro)."

Formed in 2004 after a global search, Il Divo (Italian for "divine male performer") consists of Spanish baritone Carlos Marin, American tenor David Miller, French pop singer Sebastien Izambard, and Swiss tenor Urs Buhler. It seems Cowell knew what he was doing. But we are just us, Il Divo. Marin: In a way, yeah. We knocked out Robbie Williams and it was just like "Wow!" It's magic. David Miller: Absolutely. Marin: Yes, we do! Izambard: Beyonce. Christina Aguilera.
