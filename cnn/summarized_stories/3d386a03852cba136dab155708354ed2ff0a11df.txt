One year ago, the world watched as a massive tsunami engulfed entire communities in northern Japan. "I thought Japan would disappear," one elderly survivor said in the immediate aftermath. "I thought Japan would disappear under water." Earthquakes are not uncommon for Japan, which rests on one of the world's most active fault lines. But the one that triggered the tsunami on March 11, 2011, had a magnitude of 9.0, making it the fourth-largest earthquake in the world since 1900. "My wife and I stood outside and basically held on to the outside of our house," resident Matt Alt said on the day of the quake. As of Friday, the official death toll was 15,854.
