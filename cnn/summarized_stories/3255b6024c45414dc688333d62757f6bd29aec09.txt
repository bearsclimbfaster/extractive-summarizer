A Seattle, Washington, woman who accused illusionist David Copperfield of sexually assaulting her more than two years ago has now been charged with prostitution and making a false accusation in another case, according to Copperfield's attorney and Washington state officials. The federal probe of Copperfield was officially closed earlier this month. He was once engaged to model Claudia Schiffer.
