It's not news that the national debt presents a daunting challenge. A fiscal cliff or a mountain of debt. However, the tendency during campaigns, of course, is for politicians to talk about what they promise not to do, rather than own up to the tougher decisions their stewardship would require. Both President Barack Obama and Gov. Mitt Romney would have a lot of fleshing out of their plans to do before this debate. Thus far, the president has only offered much smaller plans which are best described as a first step towards dealing with the problem rather than a full-blown plan, while Romney has offered a plan that could get control of the debt but with the bulk of the specifics on the spending cuts and tax breaks he would reduce, left blank, thus leaving none of the critical details filled in.
