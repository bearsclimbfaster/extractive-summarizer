One of the 12-year-olds charged with stabbing a friend to impress the fictional Internet bogeyman Slenderman was deemed incompetent to stand trial Friday -- at least for now -- according to court documents. After debate between prosecutors and the defense over whether a competency test would violate Morgan Geyser's rights, the judge asked the girl whether she was competent. She believes in unicorns, Lundbohm told the court. "She needs to grow up," the doctor said, according to WITI.
