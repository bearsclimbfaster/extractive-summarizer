After sparking controversy to have designer John Galliano teach a three-day master class at Parsons The New School for Design, the school announced on Wednesday the class has been canceled. "An important element of the planned workshop with John Galliano was a candid conversation about the connection between his professional work and his actions in the world at large," said Parsons in a statement. "Unfortunately, we could not reach consensus with Mr. Galliano on the conditions of this conversation, and the program could not move forward." In a previous statement, Parsons said the class was expected to give students an opportunity to learn from "an immensely talented designer."
