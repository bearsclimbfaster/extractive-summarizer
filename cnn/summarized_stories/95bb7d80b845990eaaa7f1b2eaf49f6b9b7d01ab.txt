A hostage situation in a Southern California bank ended abruptly Thursday when the suspect was shot, police said. Aerial footage showed a person being carried on a stretcher through broken glass that earlier had been the window for a Saehan Bank branch in Buena Park, about 20 miles southeast of Los Angeles. Emergency personnel could be seen attending to a person -- who appeared to be shirtless, bloodied and not moving -- before the person was taken away by ambulance. Bill Kohanek.
