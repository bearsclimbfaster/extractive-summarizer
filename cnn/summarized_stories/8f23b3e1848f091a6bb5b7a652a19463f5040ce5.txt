Roughly 700 students at the University of California, Santa Barbara, will be given a powerful antibiotic to guard against meningitis after coming in contact with four people diagnosed with meningococcal disease, county health officials said Tuesday. The news came as the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department confirmed a fourth student at the university has been diagnosed with meningococcal disease.
