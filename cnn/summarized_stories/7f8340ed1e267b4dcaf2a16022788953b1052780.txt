Aziz Ansari's never pulls punches in his stand-up, but there is a joke in his new comedy special that really pushes the envelope (forget worrying about a spoiler; we couldn't tell it here if we wanted to). Let's just say it involves child molestation, and the audience loves it. The "Parks and Recreation" star said he doesn't worry about getting caught on the wrong side of the politically correct crew as has happened to some comedians. His new special, "Aziz Ansari: Buried Alive," will debut on November 1 on Netflix. One clip from the special that has been making the rounds on YouTube features Ansari poking fun at the institution of marriage and family, life events a few of the 30-year-old's friends are experiencing now. On the controversy surrounding the Chick-fil-A boycott, he said it was a bit of a conundrum: "Obviously I'm very pro gay marriage, but I'm also very pro delicious chicken sandwich."
