It's been more than 180 years since Venezuelans saw Simon Bolivar's face. But the revolutionary leader's thick sideburns, bushy eyebrows and steely gaze popped out from behind picture frames Tuesday in new 3-D images unveiled by President Hugo Chavez. Researchers used several software programs to reconstruct the face of the man who liberated Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Peru and Venezuela from the Spanish crown. "Bolivar is and will be one of the greatest giants of humanity, of the cause and the human struggle, one of the best of the human species," Chavez said as he unveiled the portraits, according to state-run VTV. While computer modeling software played a key role in the reconstruction, Barcelona's VisualForensic laboratory also manually added in details -- like estimations of the former leader's skin color, tissue thickness and bone density, according to a Venezuelan government statement.
