CNN photojournalist Khalil Abdallah was having breakfast Saturday in a Tripoli hotel that houses foreign press when a woman burst into the restaurant, screaming that she had been raped and beaten for days by Moammar Gadhafi's brigades. Her sudden entrance startled the group of international journalists, who were about to begin another day covering the crisis in Libya. One of the few present who spoke Arabic, the photojournalist understood her pleas. "She was saying, 'We are all Libyans! " Abdallah recounted Sunday for CNN.com. The woman told the journalists that she had been picked up at a government checkpoint east of Tripoli, tied, beaten and raped for two days. Her name was Eman al-Obeidy, she said. "Look at what Gadhafi's brigades did to me!" she screamed. Reporters gathered around her, trying to calm her, Abdallah recalled. He knew that minders -- the men Libya's government assigns to foreign journalists to monitor their every move -- were nearby.
