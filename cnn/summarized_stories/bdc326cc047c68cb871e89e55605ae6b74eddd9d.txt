Pictures taken shortly after the raid that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden show three men lying dead in pools of blood and the wreckage of a U.S. helicopter abandoned during the assault. One of the dead men bears a family resemblance to bin Laden, but there was no confirmation of his identity. The pictures were published Wednesday by Reuters.
