Anna Nicole Smith's boyfriend and two doctors entered "not guilty" pleas Wednesday to new charges connected to the death of the former Playboy model and reality TV star in 2007. Howard K. Stern  appeared in court on charges connected to the death of Anna Nicole Smith. Howard K. Stern, Smith's lawyer and companion, appeared in Los Angeles County Superior Court, along with Dr. Khristine Eroshevich and Dr. Sandeep Kapoor to formally hear the charges. Smith's death in a Hollywood, Florida, hotel on February 8, 2007, was ruled to be from "acute combined drug intoxication," the Broward County, Florida medical examiner said. Stern faces 11 felony counts, while the doctors were charged with six each. The three defendants previously entered "not guilty" pleas to those charges.
