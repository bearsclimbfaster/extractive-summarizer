Consider these eight resolutions for 2013:

Take off on your own -- even if you're traveling with a group. Suggest everyone spend one morning or afternoon finding something they'll later introduce to the group. Don't let the lack of a foreign language keep you at home. When you arrive at your destination, those you'll meet won't expect fluent French, Mandarin or Swahili to flow from your lips. But you still should at least learn the pleasantries in your hosts' country -- as in "thank you," "please," "excuse me" -- before you show up. Say you're not a "tour" or "cruise" person? Many of us experienced travelers pride ourselves on making our own way in the world, seeking out B&Bs and locally owned boutique hotels. And once we arrive, we muddle through broken French-Turkish-Vietnamese-Urdu to figure out how to get around. It could be American baseball legends, classic Hollywood films or the sounds of "Soul Train." Or set sail to a destination like Antarctica or Alaska, where being on the water makes navigation easier. Don't be ashamed to fall back on what's familiar. Still, there are some days on the road -- even in incredible food destinations like Paris or Rome -- when I get a craving for McDonald's fries and nothing else will do. And that's OK. I still remember years ago when a Spanish corporate colleague hosted me for a day of sightseeing and shopping in Madrid and for a coffee break she took me not to a historical Spanish cafÃ©, but to Starbucks. I was appalled. Even though Americans earn less vacation time than most other industrialized countries -- a median 12 days, according to a recent Expedia Vacation Deprivation study -- they still tend to forgo two days.
