At his son's 11th birthday party, just before everyone was about to sing "Happy Birthday" and cut the cake, 46-year-old Dr. Carlos Zayas stepped on to the porch of his Atlanta home to take a call from another doctor about a particularly sick patient. While on the phone, Zayas reached up absent-mindedly and touched his neck. When he went to the doctor, he found out it was peripheral T-cell lymphoma, one of the rarest and most aggressive blood cancers there is. A transplant with Zayas' own bone marrow did nothing. As chairman of the department of transplantation at Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta, Zayas had helped countless patients find donors. Now it was his turn. Zayas' search failed, and there's one major reason for that: He's Hispanic. Hispanics have only a 33% chance of finding a perfect match on Be The Match, the national bone marrow donor registry, according to Dr. Willis Navarro, the medical director for transplant medical services for the registry. Partly that's because relatively few Hispanics sign up to donate: They represent 10% of people on the registry, yet 16% of the U.S. population. Language barriers explain the low rate to some extent, and so does the fact that Hispanics who are in the United States illegally are often reluctant to sign up, even though the registry doesn't share their information with the government. The other reason for the difficulty is that Hispanics often have a varied genetic background that can include European, African and Native American roots. "I'm Spanish, French and Portuguese. After the party guests left and Carlos and his two sisters had gone to bed, Zayas closed their bedroom door and told his wife, Rita, what he'd found, and that he knew it was bad news. Zayas was out of options. Please consider it.'
