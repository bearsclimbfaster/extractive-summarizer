While Americans may still deck the halls and stuff the stockings this Christmas, a new poll finds that the state of the economy is playing a major role in how Americans will celebrate it in 2013. According to the CNN/ORC International poll, Americans plan to curtail their Christmas gift giving and charitable contributions due to economic concerns, while a sizable minority of Americans, 37%, report that the economy will make the Christmas holiday more stressful. Similarly, 62% of Americans said they were cutting back on their holiday gift giving this year. This includes putting up Christmas trees, lights and other decorations outside their homes. Lastly are the 16% of Americans who fall under the "Bah, Humbug" group.
