Facebook's privacy problems have been in the news ... again. Although complaints may have started deep in the blogosphere, even Time Magazine has made them its cover story. In response, Facebook announced a new privacy model to address complaints that it's too darn hard to actually navigate privacy settings on Facebook. (Well, duh.) It's not yet clear whether Facebook's changes will satiate the Facebook citizenry (let alone the rabid critics), but the conversations about privacy settings tend to emphasize only a fraction of the core concerns. Facebook rightfully believes that it's important to give users control over their settings, to empower them to make decisions about what's accessible. They know that people aren't quitting Facebook, but that doesn't mean that users aren't frustrated or concerned (or would be if they understood what was happening). Don't get me wrong -- the privacy settings are confounding even for the most experienced digerati and I'm very glad that they're addressing this fundamental issue.
