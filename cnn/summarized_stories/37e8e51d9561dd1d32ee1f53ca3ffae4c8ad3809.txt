As Americans, we are fortunate to have the right to speak our minds. Filmmaker Michael Moore did just that with his attack on the use of military snipers in warfare just before the release of the Oscar-nominated and devastating war/anti-war movie "American Sniper," directed by Clint Eastwood. Moore obviously has the same freedom of speech right that all Americans do. In an apparent reference to Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, credited with 160 enemy kills -- the most in U.S. history -- and the movie "American Sniper," Moore commented on Twitter that his "uncle was killed by a sniper" and that he was "taught that all snipers were cowards." Moore explains snipers are 'cowards' tweet

To begin with, the reason Americans have the freedom of speech Moore was exercising is because brave men such as Kyle and other active-duty personnel and military veterans have fought to protect this precious right. Let's look at some of the basic facts surrounding Kyle's life as a Navy SEAL sniper. Kyle either trained for war or was deployed in war zones for more than 300 days a year during his service in the SEAL teams. SEAL wives basically raise their children alone. The divorce rate for SEALs is incredibly high. A sniper, who operates behind enemy lines, has one of the most demanding and dangerous duties in the Special Operations community. Snipers operating in Iraq, Afghanistan and a host of other countries often must crawl and make their way through treacherous urban or desert war-zone terrain for hours just to reach their position undetected, a position of over-watch, cover and concealment. Why 'American Sniper' is a smash hit

Military snipers are not sociopaths, coldblooded killers.
