Now that a planned cabin crew strike against British Airways is under way for the March 27-30 period, the airline has confirmed "a number of cancellations for flights," according to its Web site. So what should you do if you're holding a BA ticket and planning to fly? Here is some advice. BA says that fliers have the choice of re-booking, whether their flight is cancelled or not. It says travelers can "rebook to travel on another BA flight on the same route up to 355 days in the future at no extra charge, subject to availability." The airline says that passengers can also book an alternative BA flight from another destination at no extra charge although it will not cover expenses to the alternative airport. This depends on the number of crew who ultimately strike and how well BA's contingency plans work, but a BA spokesman told CNN that it expects to carry about 75 percent of booked passengers on its own aircraft during March 27-30.
