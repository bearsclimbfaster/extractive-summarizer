Egypt's interim leader on Sunday issued a strong warning to supporters of ousted President Mohamed Morsy, state news said. After a meeting of the National Defense Council, headed by interim President Adly Mansour, the Egyptian presidency issued the statement, calling on protesters to remain calm. It urged them to end their "incitement and hateful speech against Egyptian citizens and state institutions and end their violations of the law and endangering the safety of citizens," the state-run Al-Ahram newspaper said. According to that group, police fired live ammunition on protesters Friday and Saturday. Both men are being held along with Morsy.
