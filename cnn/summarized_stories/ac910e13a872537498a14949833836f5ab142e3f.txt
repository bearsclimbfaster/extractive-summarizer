Linda Ross was instantly hooked the moment she received her first pair of Betsey Johnson earrings as a gift for her 16th birthday. Now, amid news that 67 Betsey Johnson retail stores in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom are liquidating and closing for good, this "Betsey Girl" from Brunswick, Georgia, is scrambling to acquire as much merchandise as she can. Since the fashion house filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April, Ross has driven to the nearest boutique in Jacksonville, Florida, for loot from the brand's high-end Betsey Johnson Collection. "Her styles combine the young and girly elements -- like bows, floral patterns, excessive use of hot pink, and sparkles -- with mature and sexy elements, like corsets, high platform heels, lace, fishnets and lipstick," Ross said. At 18, Ross embodies that "not a girl, not yet a woman" aesthetic at the heart of the designer's look for decades. An icon of the "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" mentality, Johnson is known for her bold and flirty apparel and accessories that incorporate just about every motif of feminine style imaginable, from tulle and silk to pastels and sequins. The decision to shutter stores is part of a larger effort to focus on wholesale business, said a spokesman for Steve Madden, which has owned the brand's intellectual property rights since 2010. Sales will continue until July or until a store runs out of stock. Nor is Johnson disappearing the industry scene. She will stay on as creative director of Betsey Johnson and continue working on the brand's less expensive line, which is sold in department stores and specialty boutiques across the country. She even attended the annual Council of Fashion Designers of America awards on Monday, suggesting that her days of cartwheeling down the runway are not quite over. Thought she was so cool and looked like she was having so much fun, surrounded by all that color & whimsey!" Best of luck to you & thanks!" They are made for tiny women; I'm a 12.
