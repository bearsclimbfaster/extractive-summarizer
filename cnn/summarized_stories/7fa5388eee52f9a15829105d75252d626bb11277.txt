After 17 years as Chicago's archbishop, the ailing Cardinal Francis George welcomed his pending retirement Saturday with praise for his successor -- and words of relief. The Vatican on Saturday announced that Pope Francis had accepted George's resignation as archbishop and chosen Blase Cupich, bishop of Spokane, Washington, as the man who will succeed George in leading the Chicago area's 2.3 million Catholics in November. The 77-year-old George, who has been battling kidney cancer, told reporters that he'll look forward to advising the Pope as cardinal through various committees, as health permits. He currently serves 100,000 Catholics in his Spokane post, which he began in 2010. "We need comprehensive immigration reform," Cupich said. "... Every day we delay it is a day too long, and we should move on it today."
