A federal court session for a man who tried to enter the United States allegedly with a veritable potpourri of weaponry and related paraphernalia was delayed Tuesday, leaving unanswered until a rescheduled hearing Friday questions about the man, his baggage and his intentions. He faces a series of court dates, beginning with Friday's detention hearing. He won't enter a plea until October 29.
