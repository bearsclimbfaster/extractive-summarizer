As has frequently been the case in the last two-and-a-half years, I found myself this past weekend caught in an intense conversation about the ongoing civil war in Syria. This time it was with a supporter of the al-Assad government. It's a common refrain I've heard in different variations from all sides of the conflict -- there is no choice but victory. But will the United States and other key players go down that road? Initially, the protesters avoided mentioning dictator Bashar al-Assad by name. Entire neighborhoods in Homs, Aleppo, Hama, and elsewhere have been destroyed to rubble. However, both sides have committed crimes against humanity.
