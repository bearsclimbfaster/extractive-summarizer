Before she was even born, Micaela Bryan already had her own Twitter handle. Some of them are among the biggest names in sport, including Serena Williams and Novak Djokovic. The top-ranked tennis duo have both had star billing on @micaelabryan -- and Djokovic is quite the regular guest. "Uncle Rafa" might have been the early inspiration, but his on-court rival "Uncle Nole" has made a serious play for her affection. "Every time Novak sees her it's really funny, he'll say, 'Micaela, my little buddy, how are you doing?' and he'll go and give her a hug," her mom Michelle Bryan told CNN's Open Court. "

But Micaela will never forget Djokovic. When she grows up she'll have a permanent record of her encounters with Serbia's favorite sporting son -- it's all documented on social media. "She got @micaelabryan before she was born and I didn't even know about it, and then we got this picture with Nadal in Miami when he was just walking through the corridor toward the locker room and he kneeled down and took a picture with her. But we saw him hanging out at the French. By winning Wimbledon in July, they became the first doubles team to hold all four grand slams and the Olympic title at the same time -- and success in their home U.S. Open this weekend would create history as they would own all four majors in a calendar year. It's good for promoting yourself and promoting your sport.
