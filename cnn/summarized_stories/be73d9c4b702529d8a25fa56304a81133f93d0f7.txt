The organizers of the 2012 London Olympics have repeatedly asserted the value of the Games in the shape of wider involvement in sport, a lasting legacy of sporting facilities, and increased tourism. But experience from previous Games suggest differently. Not one recent Olympic host nation can point to an increase in sport participation as a result of the Olympics. As for tourism, the Olympics generally leads to a decrease in visitor spending, not an increase, as the travel industry has pointed out. Watch how Greece's Olympic dream turns sour

Despite all this, not one politician or sports administrator has come up with a plan for a better Games, an Olympics for all. This is what my book, "Why The Olympics Aren't Good For Us, And How They Can Be," uniquely sets out to do. Let's be clear: I love sport. My book is not anti-Olympics, and I will be caught up in the excitement of the Games once they begin.
