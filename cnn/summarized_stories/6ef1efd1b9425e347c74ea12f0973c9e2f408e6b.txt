The Major League Baseball regular season is about to begin. It's so close, you can taste it -- and it's not all peanuts and Cracker Jacks. Jeremy Bryant, 37, who describes himself as a die-hard Seattle Mariners fan and "the one starting the wave," is the clubhouse chef for the Mariners. More than a decade ago, Bryant and a few buddies made their way to the clubhouse after the game to seek out players' autographs. "No way, I couldn't believe my heroes were eating food like this," recalled Bryant, a graduate of the Culinary Arts Program at South Seattle Community College. Bryant never heard from him. He kept coming back ... and back ... and back.
