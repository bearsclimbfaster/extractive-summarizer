At his version of an ICU unit, Jaret Daniels pays extraordinary attention to his young charges. Not just any food will do. In their climate-controlled environment, the Schaus swallowtail caterpillars munch voraciously on wild lime. Daniels, an entomologist at the University of Florida, is raising seven immature butterflies belonging to a species that is critically endangered and just "hanging on." The pressure, Daniels said, is enough to keep him up at night. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued an emergency directive in 2012 to collect females in Biscayne National Park and raise their eggs. While no females were collected last year, officials announced this week that an adult female was snared on the park's Elliott Key last month, along with six larvae. Federal and state officials say the Schaus' hopes might depend on a breeding program that may help safeguard a portion of the remaining population. The Schaus swallowtail, contained to a relatively small area in southeastern Florida, in 1976 was listed under the Endangered Species Act as threatened. Habitat destruction, drought, hurricanes and pesticide use outside Biscayne National Park were likely contributing factors to the insect's demise, experts say.
