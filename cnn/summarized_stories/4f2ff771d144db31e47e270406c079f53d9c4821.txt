During his trip to northwest Syria in late April, Ole Solvang talked to dozens of people who told him gut-wrenching stories. When the Human Rights Watch interviewer and his colleagues returned home, they titled their report "They burned my heart: War crimes in Northern Idlib during peace plan negotiations." "It's been frustrating to record these stories and then hear more negotiating," said Solvang, who describes in a video what he saw. This week, a bomb exploded near a United Nations convoy of workers tasked with monitoring whether a peace plan is working. On Thursday, two car bombs also exploded outside a key government intelligence compound in Damascus. Thursday's explosions, which killed more than 50 people, are believed to mark a major point in the conflict. More violence came Friday, according to an opposition group. The architect of the peace plan, Kofi Annan, the United Nations special envoy to Syria, has said that he is now weighing an invitation to meet with al-Assad. Solvang and his team knew the risk they took in entering Syria. They visited homes in the province of Idlib and say they hundreds of ruined homes in various towns, many probably from systemic house-by-house arson attacks. He has focused on Syria since the anti-Assad movement exploded in March 2011.
