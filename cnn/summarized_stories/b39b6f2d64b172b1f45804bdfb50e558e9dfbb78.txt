Clothing retailer Gap Inc. has fired an Indian company accused of using child labor to make clothes, the company's president said. Dan McDougall of the Observer said these were among the children working in an Indian factory, making clothing. "It's deeply, deeply disturbing to all of us," Gap President Marka Hansen said Sunday after watching a video of children at work in a New Delhi, India, sweatshop. "I feel violated and I feel very upset and angry with our vendor and the subcontractor who made this very, very, very unwise decision," Hansen said. Hansen blamed the alleged abuse on an unauthorized subcontractor for one of its Indian vendors and said the subcontractor's relationship with the Gap had been "terminated."
