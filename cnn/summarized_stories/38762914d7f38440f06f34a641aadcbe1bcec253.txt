The regime of ousted leader Moammar Gadhafi and the rebel government -- the National Transitional Council -- have both committed war crimes during the conflict in Libya and someone needs to take control to stop abuses from continuing, Amnesty International said in a report released Tuesday. The 112-page report detailed many examples of abuses by the Gadhafi loyalists, which included "mass killing of prisoners, torture, enforced disappearances, and arbitrary arrests." "It is the responsibility of the National (Transitional) Council to investigate these crimes," she said. "So far, NTC officials have not provided details of any measures taken to address such concerns." Gadhafi officials could not immediately be reached for comment on the report. The NTC released a statement about the report Tuesday. Amnesty said it was up to the NTC to fix these issues.
