Frankel and Black Caviar. While that once meant "Who would win if they went head to head?" Frankel has posted nearly $3 million in prize money for the Juddmonte Farm stables, with an unbeaten run in 12 encounters. Frankel is now rated as the best performer on the flat in the world by race statistics company Timeform -- which since 1948 has been using a mathematical equation comparing race results to the weight of the horse plus distance run to create a hierarchy which is used in many form guides for racegoers and owners. While performance on the turf is not always a leading indication of performance in retirement, top bloodstock experts say Frankel's lifetime value in stud could be around $155 million. "Frankel will have the pick of the best mares when it is time for him to stud, and there is no mare out there at the moment attracting as much attention as Black Caviar," says Johnny McKeever, who has 25 years of experience in buying horses which have gone on to win major Group One meets around the world. he told CNN. And that initial stud fee is set to break the current world record held by Irish horse Sea The Stars, who earned nearly $7 million in prize money from a series of wins in major Group One races such as the Prix de L'Arc de Triomphe and the Epsom Derby.
