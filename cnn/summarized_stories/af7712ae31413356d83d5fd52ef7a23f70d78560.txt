A U.S. Navy submarine leaked trace amounts of radioactive water for two years as it made port calls in Japan and other Asian nations, the Navy said Thursday. The USS Houston arrives in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, for routine maintenance, during which the leak was found. Last week, Navy officials told Japan that the USS Houston, a Los Angeles-class fast attack submarine, had made one port call -- in March -- while leaking the contaminated fluid. But after reviewing records of the sub, the Navy told Japanese officials Thursday that the Houston had been leaking much longer, since June 2006, and had made port calls to Japanese bases at Sasebo, Yokosuka and Okinawa before the leak was discovered. The Houston also made stops in Guam and Hawaii. "At the same time, what remains to be nailed down is the cause," said the spokesman, Hiroshi Suzuki.
