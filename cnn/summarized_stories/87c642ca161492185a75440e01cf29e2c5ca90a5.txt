A top Republican leader agreed Thursday with President Barack Obama and Democrats that extending the payroll tax cut would help the economy, but the parties remained divided over how to pay for the move. Later Thursday, the Senate blocked competing Democratic and Republican proposals from moving forward, setting up negotiations on a possible compromise. Taxpayers with an income of $50,000 would benefit by $1,500 a year. Senate Republicans prevented Democrats from getting the 60 votes needed to proceed on the measure, which was blocked on a 51-49 vote. President Barack Obama quickly blamed Republicans, saying in a statement that they "chose to raise taxes on nearly 160 million hardworking Americans because they refused to ask a few hundred thousand millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share." "It makes absolutely no sense to raise taxes on the middle class at a time when so many are still trying to get back on their feet," Obama said, adding he would "continue to urge Congress to stop playing politics with the security of millions of American families and small business owners and get this done." A Republican alternative that would freeze discretionary government spending and cut federal jobs, while also raising Medicare costs for Americans with incomes above $750,000 a year, also got blocked by opposition from both parties on a 20-78 vote. House Republican leaders are working on their own proposal to extend unemployment benefits and the payroll tax cut, but several GOP aides told CNN it was unclear if these extensions would be rolled into one bill or end up as separate legislative proposals. GOP leaders planned a closed-door meeting Friday morning to discuss options with rank-and-file members on how to pay for the extensions.
