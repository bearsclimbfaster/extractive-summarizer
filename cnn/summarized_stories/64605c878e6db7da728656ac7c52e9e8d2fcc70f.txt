English Premier League Fulham produced a superb performance in Switzerland on Wednesday to eliminate opponents Basel from the Europa League with a 3-2 victory. Roy Hodgson's men went into the away game needing victory to leapfrog their opponents and join Group E winners AS Roma in the last 32 of Europe's second-tier club competition. Fulham were led by striker Bobby Zamora, who capped a recent scoring spree with two goals just before halftime.
