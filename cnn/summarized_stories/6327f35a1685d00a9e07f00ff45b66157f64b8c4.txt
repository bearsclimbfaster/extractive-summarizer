Margaret Chin stands 4 feet 11, but the veteran community activist is casting a long shadow over the political landscape in New York. Chin is poised to win election next month as the first Chinese-American on the New York City Council to represent New York's Chinatown, one of the largest concentrations of Chinese outside of mainland China. She ousted a two-term incumbent in September's Democratic primary and will be on the ballot November 3 in a district that overwhelmingly favors Democrats. For Chin, a 56-year-old Hong Kong immigrant, the long road to political victory has not been easy. As she closes in on a probable November victory, though, she's confident the lessons learned along the way will serve her -- and her constituents -- well. Chin's American story began almost a half century ago, during the Kennedy administration. Her father, seeking new opportunities, left China for Colombia. A few months later, he became an undocumented U.S. worker, scratching out a living as a waiter in the Bronx section of New York. Margaret, the third of five children, remembers her dad's exhaustion and pain after spending long days on his feet. They were wonderful." Chin's father died a long time ago, but his decision to pursue the American dream -- starting as an undocumented immigrant -- left a lasting impression on his only daughter. They struggle. Repairing the city's aging infrastructure is also a priority in a sprawling Manhattan district that encompasses Chinatown as well as Wall Street, Soho, the Lower East Side, Tribeca, and Battery Park City. "This City Council district was drawn in the early 1990s in part to enable Chinatown residents to elect a candidate of choice," noted Margaret Fung, head of New York's Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund. In the past decade, the total nationwide population of Asians and Pacific Islanders jumped to almost 13 million, a nearly 50 percent increase since 1990, according to the Asian American Action Fund.
