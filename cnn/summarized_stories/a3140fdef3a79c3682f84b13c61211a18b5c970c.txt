As the immigration debate moves to the House of Representatives, Americans are fully engaged. Not many are. Worst of all, as bad as the immigration problem is, some of the solutions they propose range from the nonworkable to the nonsensical. The son of a Pennsylvania coal miner and a graduate of Yale Law School and Oxford University, my buddy wanted to put in his two cents about immigration -- and how to fix a broken system. A moderate Republican, he doesn't support the bill that the Senate passed by a vote of 68-32, and he is looking for something better. He doesn't mind the idea of legalizing at least some of the undocumented, but he wants the United States to secure the border first. He's reasonable, but this issue troubles him -- and so do some of the proposed remedies. As for his solution, my friend blurted out: "Why don't we just do whatever Mexico does? Ay Chihuahua. Accounts in the media over the last several years have detailed how badly Mexico treats immigrants from Central America who try to enter illegally through its southern border on their way to the United States. No, thank you. Not for this Mexican-American.
