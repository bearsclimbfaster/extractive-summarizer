Metallica appeared at Comic-Con in San Diego on Friday to promote their upcoming 3-D IMAX concert film "Metallica Through the Never." The band debuted footage from the movie to a crowd of fans in the Convention Center's Hall H and later rocked an intimate crowd at a secret show. "Metallica Through the Never" was directed by Nimrod Antal ("Predators") and intersperses live Metallica concert footage with a fictional narrative about a young roadie named Trip who is sent on a mission during the show. Actor Dane DeHaan ("The Amazing Spider-Man 2") plays Trip in the film. That's what we've always done. We wanted animation, we wanted CGI -- you name it!
