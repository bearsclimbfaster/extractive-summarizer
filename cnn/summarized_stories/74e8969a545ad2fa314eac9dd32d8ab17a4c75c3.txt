What divorce rumors? Say what you will about superstar couple Beyonce and Jay Z, but they appear determined to keep fans guessing. As the pair wrapped up their very successful "On The Run" tour in Paris over the weekend, there was speculation that Beyonce may be pregnant with their second child, a marked turn from the breakup chatter that surrounded the pair at the start of the tour in June. So how did the narrative switch so rapidly? Apparently with very little help from Mr. and Mrs. Carter. After Beyonce's sister, Solange, was shown on surveillance video fighting her rapper brother-in-law after the Met Gala in New York City, there were whispers that divorce was on the horizon.
