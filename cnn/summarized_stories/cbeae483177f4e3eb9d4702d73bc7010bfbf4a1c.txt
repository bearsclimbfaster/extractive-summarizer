A judge has concluded that 13-year-old Jahi McMath, who suffered complications after tonsil surgery, is brain dead. But it's unclear what will happen next to the California teen. An attorney representing her family told reporters they haven't decided yet whether to appeal the judge's decision, which came after a court-appointed doctor testified Tuesday that Jahi was brain dead. The judge has ruled that Jahi will remain on life support at least until December 30. Family members said they planned to spend Christmas in her hospital room, opening gifts and sipping hot chocolate. Earlier Tuesday, Children's Hospital & Research Center Oakland argued that the court should lift a restraining order that requires life support for the girl. "Because Ms. McMath is dead, practically and legally, there is no course of medical treatment to continue or discontinue; there is nothing to which the family's consent is applicable," the hospital wrote in court papers. Standing outside the courthouse on Tuesday, family members said they were hoping for a holiday miracle while Jahi remains hospitalized. Mother: 'I won't stop fighting' for daughter
