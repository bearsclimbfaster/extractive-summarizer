Bettye Webb-Hayes won't ever forget the day her son posed a question that stopped her in her tracks. It was something you didn't talk about in the days of the segregated South -- especially when your mom was white and your father was a mix of African-American and Native American. She went to the black schools of Macon, Georgia. Now, her son was asking probing questions. she said. "Because everybody at school calls me a honky," said the young Cordell, a light-skinned African-American. Bettye and her son recently traveled back to Macon to face something that's been omnipresent their whole lives: the coming together of white and black. Ruby Dean Dupree Mayes arrived two hours early for the festivities. "It's like waiting for Santa Claus to arrive. I'm so excited," said Mayes, who drove more than 330 miles from Tennessee to attend. Mayes went to Ballard-Hudson High, the city's black high school, whose most famous students include singers Otis Redding and Little Richard. Gradually, they began mixing and mingling. Discuss the past, while moving forward in the present. The idea for the meeting began four years ago, when a son told his father: "Dad, think about how many friends you missed getting to know." Those were the words of Wyatt Johnson, a public school teacher in Santa Cruz, California. Yet despite all his accomplishments, there was something he'd never done: reach out to the African-Americans of Macon from 1959, the ones he never knew because of segregation. He wrote to graduates of the black school, Ballard-Hudson; the white girls' school, Miller; and the white boys' school, Lanier. Here, there were tears, hugs and handshakes.
