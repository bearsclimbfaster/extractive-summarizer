Friday, President Barack Obama walked into the White House briefing room and gave the American people his thoughts on the Trayvon Martin case. He was reflective. He said that 35 ago, "Trayvon Martin could have been me." Within moments of his speech, cable news and Twitter was full of comments from the right questioning the president's motives and words. Some said that by raising this issue, he was not being a president for everyone, just for African-Americans. Because while Obama's comments may have been focused on some of the racial divisions we face as a nation, to me his remarks were about so much more. Far too many people of different backgrounds who feel targeted, mocked, or looked down upon by others. Obama's comments don't just speak to the young black man who worries he's being followed, or who sees other people look at him with fear. He spoke to the young Indian-American man, born and raised in this country, who is mocked and called a racial slur and told "welcome to America" by a U.S. senator because his skin color is a little darker.
