The Michael Jackson-Conrad Murray relationship may serve as a cautionary tale for any health care provider who works with celebrities. Regardless of whether you agree with the verdict on Murray, who was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter Monday in Jackson's death, there is little doubt that what served as "health care" for Jackson would hardly meet quality standards, and some would characterize it as drug dealing. There are several factors:

--Health care providers are no different from anyone else. It is hard not to be seduced by this "Alice in Wonderland" world. Becoming a contracted health care provider, such as Murray was for Jackson, allows the provider to accompany the celebrity on this magic carpet ride. Until the carpet crashes. However, I have noticed in many different health care settings that when a celebrity is involved, waiting times are shortened, scarce specialty appointments are miraculously found, staff is just a little more polite and solicitous, and the entire unwieldy health care process is a little more user friendly. With the strict Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act guidelines protecting patient privacy, the public should never be aware of which doctor or institution is caring for a patient.
