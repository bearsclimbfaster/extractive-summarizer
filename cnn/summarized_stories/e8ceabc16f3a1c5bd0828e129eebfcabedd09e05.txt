Francois Hollande defeated French President Nicolas Sarkozy in a presidential runoff Sunday, signaling a shift to the left as the country and Europe fight to dig out of a weak economy. In a victory speech to supporters in Tulle, Hollande declared his win "a great date for our country, and a new start for Europe." The Socialist challenger promised to govern for all of France. Others, younger, have never known such a time. "Tonight, there are not two Frances. There is only one France, only one nation that is united with the same destiny," Hollande said. The president-elect, who will be the nation's first left-wing president since Francois Mitterrand left office in 1995, suggested there was a sense of relief in many European countries because of his win. Later, Hollande went to Paris, where he addressed a large crowd at the Bastille.
