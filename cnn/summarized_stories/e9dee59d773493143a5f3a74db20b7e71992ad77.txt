British military advisers are training Ukrainian troops in Ukraine, the UK said Thursday, as part of efforts to support the government in Kiev as it combats pro-Russian separatists in the east. Prime Minister David Cameron announced last month that Britain would send military advisers to Ukraine and provide an additional 15 million pounds ($22.3 million) in humanitarian aid. Russia is under continued pressure from the West to end its support for the separatists. "It does not contribute to a peaceful and lasting settlement of the situation in Georgia."
