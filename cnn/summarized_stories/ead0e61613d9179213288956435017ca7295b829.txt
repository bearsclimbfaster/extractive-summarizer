Bryan Beer, a citrus grower in southwestern Florida, sees himself as a bit of a pioneer. He's not digging for gold. It's more like he's planting for oil. Bryan Beer and his family have grown citrus for 40 years. "Any kind of relief or help we can get from a cheaper source of oil could impact the agricultural industry tremendously throughout the country, throughout the world," said Beer, whose family has been growing citrus for decades. Jatropha means "doctor food." It originated in South America, where it was once used for medicinal purposes. Sound like a pipe dream? It's not. It's being taken very seriously by companies all over the world, including the Chrysler motor company and Air New Zealand. Air New Zealand says the quality and quantity of the product may be so good that the airline could run the test flight without having to mix the jatropha biofuel with any normal aviation fuel.
