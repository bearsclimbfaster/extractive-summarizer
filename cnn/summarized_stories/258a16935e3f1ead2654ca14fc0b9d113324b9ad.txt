It underlies the stories of Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Jesus and Judas. What is our human nature? But what determines which part of our character emerges? Wait -- morality is chemical? In my TED talk, I describe how I made the unlikely discovery of the moral molecule, how I was roundly discouraged from even looking for such a chemical, and what drove me to persist in my search. For example, in one experiment we randomly matched strangers in the lab by computer and put $10 in an account for each of them. Whatever is transferred is removed from DM1's account but is tripled in DM2's account. The amount sent back comes out of DM2's account one for one and is not tripled -- it's a pure loss to DM2. For example, if DM1 transfers $8, he or she would keep $2 and DM2 would receive $24 (=3 x $8). The DM1 to DM2 transfer is understood to be a measure of trust, while the DM2 to DM1 transfer measures trustworthiness. And then there is Adam Smith.
