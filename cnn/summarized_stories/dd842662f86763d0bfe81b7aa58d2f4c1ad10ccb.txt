Officials sparred Sunday over a proposed plan to send observers into Syria as the nation's president warned against military intervention. In an interview with the Sunday Times in the United Kingdom, President Bashar al-Assad warned that any potential military intervention against his country would lead to "very dire" repercussions, and said that Syria "will not bow down" despite international threats of economic sanctions over the government's crackdown on protesters. He accused the Arab League, which recently suspended Syria's membership, of helping pave the way for western intervention. Meanwhile, Syria's foreign minister said an Arab League plan to send observers into his country needed clarification before Syria would sign on. The situation does not bear or require hastiness or reaction," Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem told reporters, urging the Arab League to take more time to develop a plan that the organization's foreign ministers approved last week. "It requires a study that is rational, because clearly any analysis shows that some Arab parties want to use the Arab League as a tool to get to the (United Nations) Security Council." On Wednesday, Arab League foreign ministers gave Damascus three days to implement a protocol to allow observers to enter the nation to verify whether the regime has taken measures to protect civilians. "The Arab League, they ignore the presence of armed groups, the terrorist armed groups who kill the people, and if they would recognize the presence of such groups they would not have conducted themselves in the way they are behaving," he said. Moallem told reporters that report was "completely untrue."
