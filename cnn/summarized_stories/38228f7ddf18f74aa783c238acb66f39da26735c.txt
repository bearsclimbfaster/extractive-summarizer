Romania insisted Wednesday there was no evidence it had hosted secret CIA prisons as part of the United States' "global war on terror" after September 11, 2001. The country "has no information whatsoever showing that there existed secret CIA detention centers on its territory," the Foreign Ministry told CNN. Two investigations also failed to find any evidence that the CIA used Romanian airports for "rendition," the process in which detainees in American custody are transported for questioning to other countries where prohibitions on torture are not as strict and American laws don't apply. Efforts to challenge the agency and get details about it in U.S. courts have been turned aside. Lithuania has not responded to CNN questions about the issue.
