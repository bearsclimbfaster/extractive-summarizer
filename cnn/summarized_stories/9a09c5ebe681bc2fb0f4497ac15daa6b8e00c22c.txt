For most of her life, Kimberly Jensen has spent Valentine's Day alone. But on Saturday she will be cuddling up to a complete stranger. The 47-year-old, who is perpetually single, is one of more than 100 people attending Cuddle Con, which bills itself as the world's first ever cuddle convention in Portland, Oregon. "I hated Valentine's Day, and now I am looking forward to it. I am hoping to cuddle non-stop," Jensen said. The 12-hour convention, which is strictly platonic and nonsexual, was created by professional cuddler Samantha Hess. She came across a photo on Facebook of a man offering free hugs, and a newly divorced Hess thought to herself that she would definitely pay someone for a hug right at that moment. So they come into (my business) and get touch from me."
