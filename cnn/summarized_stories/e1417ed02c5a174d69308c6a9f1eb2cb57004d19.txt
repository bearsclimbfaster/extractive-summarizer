A Norwegian shipping firm has ordered its vessels to avoid the waters off the Horn of Africa and criticized governments for failing to curb a wave of piracy after Somalia-based hijackers seized their largest prize to date.

The decision by the maritime company Odfjell SE means its 90-plus ships will take the additional time and expense to sail around the southern tip of Africa instead of going through the Suez Canal, a shortcut for mariners for nearly a century and a half. "It is a huge step, but what we have seen is that the piracy activity in the area has increased," the company's president, Terje Storeng, told CNN. Storeng said in a statement the company will still sail through the Gulf of Aden only if explicitly committed to doing so by existing contracts. The Gulf of Aden, which lies between the Horn of Africa and the Arabian peninsula, is the gateway to the southern Red Sea, which is linked to the Mediterranean by the Suez Canal. Going around the Cape of Good Hope would add thousands of kilometers to a voyage from the Middle East to Europe or North America. Map of the new route Â»

The announcement followed Monday's news that the 300,000-metric-ton oil tanker Sirius Star was captured by pirates in the Indian Ocean over the weekend. The hijacking took place more than 720 km (450 miles) off the Kenyan port of Mombasa, well south of the zone patrolled by international warships in an effort to clamp down on the pirates.
