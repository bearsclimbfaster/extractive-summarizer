Just days after he was released from a Louisiana prison for a murder he said he didn't commit, Herman Wallace has died, his legal team said Friday. Wallace -- one of the "Angola 3" inmates who protested what they said were injustices at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola -- died Friday morning at age 71 after a fight with liver cancer, his legal team said. "Although his freedom was much too brief, it meant the world to Herman to spend these last three days surrounded by the love of his family and friends," the team said. I am free.'" Ordering Wallace's release Tuesday, U.S. District Chief Judge Brian A. Jackson in Baton Rouge ruled that women were systematically excluded from the grand jury that indicted Wallace in the 1972 slaying of guard Brent Miller at Angola.
