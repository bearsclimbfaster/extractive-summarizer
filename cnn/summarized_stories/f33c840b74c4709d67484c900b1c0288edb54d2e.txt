Psychic or just plain phony? If there was any reason to believe that a crystal ball is hiding in that bulbous head of Paul the octopus, be warned: This article might just disappoint. Ready? Some marine biologists and experts say it's more than likely that Paul doesn't have the gift of prophecy after all. The 2-year-old octopus, who was born in England and now lives in a German aquarium, has become a World Cup phenomenon after correctly predicting the winners in all six of the German national team's matches. "He has a run that many gamblers will only ever dream of," said Tony LaCasse, a spokesman for the New England Aquarium. LaCasse said that at the New England Aquarium, which has a giant Pacific octopus, marine biologists usually give the animals Plexiglas boxes with different latches, lids and arrangements to see if they are able to retrieve their food.
