Serbia hosted the Third Meeting of Heads of Government of China and Central and Eastern Europe this week, marking the first visit of a Chinese Premiere to Belgrade in 28 years. The Balkan nation has positioned itself as an attractive destination for Chinese investment over the last decade, with a number of big projects in the pipeline. One of them is the China-funded Zemun-Borca bridge over the Danube river which was ceremonially opened by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Serbian prime minister Aleksandar Vucic Thursday. Serbia is increasingly looking to invest in big infrastructure projects in Southeast Europe in order to ease the passage of its goods from the Greek port of Piraeus, which is under a 35-year concession by Chinese shipping giant Cosco, to western Europe. CNN's Paula Newton sat down with Vucic in Belgrade ahead of the summit to discuss the government's efforts against corruption, Serbia's strategy for EU membership and the Kosovo issue. CNN: Strategically, why is it so important at this point in time to be having this summit and to invite so many different countries? Aleksandar Vucic: It is actually the third summit in a row that is taking place here in Belgrade and we are very satisfied because of that fact.
