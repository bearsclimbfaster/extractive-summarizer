Now, one year into my 40s, I'm blessed with home ownership and the realization that I am officially a "grown-up." "So, what do you plan to do with THESE bedrooms?" I pondered the question each time, realizing I couldn't say I'd use it as an office since I had one set up downstairs. My first response was "with whom?" Also, it's not to say that these questions about marriage didn't occur in those earlier years. So, needless to say, my friends and family saw my house as a symbol of my last-ditch effort to claim a white picket fenced yard filled with kids. Was I, in fact, laying the groundwork for the future I hoped to have -- of marriage, children and a dog? So, I might have another barbecue for the Fourth of July.
