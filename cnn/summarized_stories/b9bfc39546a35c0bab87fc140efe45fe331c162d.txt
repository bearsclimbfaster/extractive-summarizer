Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard says he is happy to stay with the English Premier League side after reported interest from Spanish giants Real Madrid. Gerrard's future was the subject of much speculation after Liverpool finished seventh last season and failed to qualify for the lucrative European Champions League. The 30-year-old delayed any decision until after the World Cup, where he captained England to a disappointing second round exit at the hands of Germany. He was linked with a move to Jose Mourinho's Real Madrid but he has underlined his commitment to Liverpool after a private meeting with manager Roy Hodgson, who took over from Rafael Benitez earlier this month.
