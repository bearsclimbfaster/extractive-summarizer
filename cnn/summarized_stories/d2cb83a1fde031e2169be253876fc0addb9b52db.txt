Following the nuclear power plant crisis in Japan, China has ordered safety inspections of its existing nuclear plants and suspension of new plant approvals. The decision was made on March 16 during a meeting of Premier Wen Jiabao with the State Council, China's cabinet. Beijing's top nuclear power regulatory body quickly unveiled a series of guidelines advising nuclear power plants to take disaster stress tests on planned and existing projects. Changhua Wu, the Greater China director of The Climate Group, a non-profit group advocating environmental protection, applauded the decision. Read whether the fear for nuclear disasters is realistic

China operates 13 nuclear reactors, a small number compared to the 104 in the United States, but China is poised to catch up. It's building more than two dozen others -- roughly 40 percent of all the reactors under construction worldwide -- and 50 more are being proposed. In the last two decades, China's energy needs have grown exponentially due to its rapid economic boom and urbanization. China has turned to alternative sources of energy -- wind, solar and nuclear power -- to improve air quality and curb global warming. "Nuclear power is seen as cost-effective, low carbon, and more reliable than renewable energy such as solar and wind power, which can only provide power some of the time," noted Century Weekly, a Chinese-language magazine popular among intellectuals. Kang Rixin, a senior Communist Party member and head of China's nuclear power program, was convicted last November in a $260 million corruption case in which he was accused of rigging bids connected to nuclear power plant construction.
