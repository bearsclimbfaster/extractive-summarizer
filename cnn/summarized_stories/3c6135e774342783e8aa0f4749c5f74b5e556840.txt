The actions of a justice of the peace in Louisiana who refused to issue a marriage license to an interracial couple have prompted some top officials, including Gov. Bobby Jindal, to call for his dismissal. Beth Humphrey and Terence McKay say they were denied a marriage license because of their race. Jindal said the state judiciary committee should review the incident in which Keith Bardwell, justice of the peace for Tangipahoa Parish's 8th Ward, refused to issue a marriage license to Beth Humphrey, 30, and her boyfriend, Terence McKay, 32, both of Hammond. ... Disciplinary action should be taken immediately -- including the revoking of his license," the Republican governor said. "I'm not a racist," Bardwell told the newspaper.
