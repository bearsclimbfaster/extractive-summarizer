A series of car and roadside bombs targeting buses and bus stations rocked predominately Shiite areas of Iraq on Thursday, killing at least 19 people and wounding more than 100, police said. Two separate incidents happened at bus stations in Karbala province, south of Baghdad. Overall, violence has dropped significantly in the country since the peak of sectarian violence between 2005 and 2007, but flare-ups have become commonplace again recently.
