Singer Beyonce, the United Nations and dozens of global aid groups have one message for the world Sunday: Perform a good deed, no matter how big or small, to help another person. Sunday marks World Humanitarian Day, which honors those who face danger in helping others and also encourages people to volunteer or help someone in need. Beyonce and aid organizations are trying to reach 1 billion people through social media for this year's campaign, called "I Was Here." "'I Was Here' says I want to leave my footprints in the sands of time, and that is leaving our mark on the world," Beyonce told CNN's Anderson Cooper.
