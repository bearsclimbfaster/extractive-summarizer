But five tobacco manufacturers have argued in federal court that what the government has ordered is in violation of the First Amendment. The government derives the power to do this from the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009, which was enacted by Congress. The R.J. Reynolds Co., manufacturer of Camel, Kool, Winston and Salem cigarettes, has said that the government-ordered images are "intended to elicit loathing, disgust and repulsion." U.S. District Judge Richard Leon appears to believe the cigarette manufacturers have a strong case. Back in November he issued a temporary injunction that blocked the forced publication of the images. At a hearing this month, he said: "There's nothing on the record to suggest that Congress gave any clear and thoughtful analysis on the First Amendment implications of this." No matter how much many of us may dislike what cigarettes have done to the nation's health, the First Amendment argument is a compelling one. I recently saw a November 1936 national magazine advertisement for Camels, which presented cheerful, colorfully illustrated, course-by-course instructions on how to smoke five cigarettes at the table during Thanksgiving dinner to achieve "the peaceful feeling that comes from good digestion and smoking Camels." Camels ease tension." It goes on. In 1954, when health concerns about cigarettes were gaining momentum, the Old Gold brand took out a double-spread national magazine ad that all but mocked the medical evidence.
