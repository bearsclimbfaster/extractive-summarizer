One by one, with a hand as steady as a surgeon's, Lorna Patrick removes eggs from a sea turtle's nest on a Florida beach. "If it falls, you probably killed the hatchling that's developing inside," said Patrick, a biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Patrick admits she holds her breath each time she takes an egg out of the sand and places it in the foam cooler. "We're confident if they go into oil they're going to die." Fish and Wildlife Service.
