With less than 48 hours to go before our Fit Nation team tackles its first triathlon in Malibu, California, we asked them to reflect on the past nine months of training. Every ride I had until the midway trip in Florida was full of fear and white knuckles. But on the midway trip, Coach April got inside my head and heart. During a bike ride, she said, "I want you to know you deserve this -- all the time and work you've put into this. It's worth it; all you have to do is let go and take it." Here's mine: "I am not defined by the scars of my past. When I find it difficult to accept what I have no control over, I will let go and trust in God to guide me." -- Annette Miller

Giving up is not an option. Life is never going to stop. The ups and downs of being a human being on God's green Earth are going to continue whether we like it or not. Don't get me wrong; being on the Fit Nation team has been an awesome experience. I've fallen so many times, and in so many ways, yet I'm not giving up on my goal of crossing the finish line in Malibu. Fast enough.
