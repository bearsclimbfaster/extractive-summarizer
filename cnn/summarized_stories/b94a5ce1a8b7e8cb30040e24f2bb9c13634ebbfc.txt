It's not unusual for men to join the fight for women's rights. But it is if they choose to wear miniskirts while they do it. The brutal murder of a Turkish woman, Ozgecan Aslan, 20, who allegedly fought off a sexual assault before her body was burned and dumped in a riverbed, has sparked protests on the street and social media. The Twitter hashtag #OzgecanAslan prompted thousands of tweets, with many women posting photos of themselves clad in black. And in recent days, #ozgecanicinminietekgiy, translated as "wear a miniskirt for Ozgecan," has begun circulating, often accompanied with a photo of a man wearing a short skirt. Prominent Turkish lawyer and activist Hulya Gulbahar said the skirt protest is "very effective" and the first time women's rights have been so widely endorsed in Turkey. But they didn't find any in this case, because Aslan was very innocent, purely innocent. In a joint statement last week, representatives from U.N. Women and UNFPA said: "Notwithstanding the progress in Turkish legislation and institutional structuring, recent data on violence against women shows insignificant improvement since 2008 and violence against women is still pervasive with two out of every five women in Turkey exposed to sexual and physical violence."
