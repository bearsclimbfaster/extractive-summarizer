A 6-year-old girl has died after her 8-year-old brother took her on a joyride in their mother's car and crashed Wednesday night in South Phoenix, police said. The children's mother believed they had been kidnapped when she discovered they were missing, said Sgt. Steve Martos of the Phoenix Police Department. "It's a tragic story, all the way round," said Martos, who did not give the children's names. As they came out to check with neighbors, the children's mother discovered that her car -- a 2010 Hyundai Elantra which had been parked outside -- was also gone, Martos said.
