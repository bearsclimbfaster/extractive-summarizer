Copenhagen Zoo, which gained notoriety last month for killing a young giraffe named Marius and feeding his corpse to the lions, has hit the headlines again, as a healthy family of lions has now joined its growing death tally. In remarks reminiscent of those made to justify the death of Marius, the zoo's director Steffen StrÃ¦de claimed the lions had to be put down "partly to avoid inbreeding between the two young lions and their father." But this is not the answer. Zoos manage animals in confined spaces. A report commissioned and published by the zoo industry in 2011 demonstrated that it lags behind charitable organizations The Nature Conservancy and the WWF Global Network in its financial support for conservation efforts. Indeed, the report demonstrated that the financial contribution of the "global zoo community" collectively is less than the contribution made by two individual not-for-profit organisations independently of one another.
