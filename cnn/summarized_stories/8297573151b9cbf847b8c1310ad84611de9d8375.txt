Outside the Dutch Embassy in Moscow, people have left flowers and cuddly toys at a makeshift memorial for the lives lost in a conflict-scarred corner of eastern Ukraine. Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 fell from the sky in Donetsk on Thursday, killing all aboard. The United States accuses Moscow of supporting the pro-Russian rebels that it suspects shot down the aircraft. Russia denies involvement, with Russian President Vladimir Putin saying Ukraine's military operation against the rebels is to blame for the tragedy. With rebels in control of the crash area, and reports of bodies and wreckage being tampered with, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told reporters he had a "very intense" conversation with Putin on Saturday. The tributes at the Dutch Embassy in Moscow include a hand-drawn picture of a plane broken in midair with the caption "children should not die," in a child's handwriting.
