It's no easy matter becoming a world class tennis player. It's even harder when everyone (really -- everyone) is calling you the "new Martina Hingis". No pressure then on the 17-year-old Swiss tennis prodigy Belinda Bencic. "Belinda is the best junior player in the world and I think that shows that she has a great potential," said Hingis' mother Melanie Molitor, who has been working with Bencic for over a decade. As for Belinda it's all up to her and what she makes of it. But the road to greatness is paved with many pitfalls as Bencic discovers two hours into her deadlocked Family Circle semifinal clash against a faultless Jana Cepelova earlier this month. And Bencic knows it. A big year

Weeks before, as Bencic sits courtside at the Chris Evert Tennis Academy in Boca Raton, Florida -- the training facility that she and her family have made their winter home -- she cuts an entirely different figure. Beaming a smile in the Florida sun, Bencic reflects on a year that started as she exploded out of tennis' youth divisions by taking the junior crowns at Wimbledon and the French Open -- before rising to become world junior No. Arriving at January's Australian Open unseeded, she fought through three qualifying rounds, and broke 43-year-old Kimiko Date-Krumm 10 times on the way to an impressive first-round win. Faced, next, with Chinese star Li Na -- and her first chance to shock the tennis world -- Bencic kept a steady head, insisting she "didn't have much to lose."
