Italy pushed back Wednesday against a European court ruling that crucifixes in classrooms violate students' right to freedom of religion and education. The European Court of Human Rights found unanimously in November that the display of a particular religious symbol -- such as the Christian cross -- in a classroom "restricted the right of parents to educate their children in conformity with their convictions, and the right of children to believe or not to believe." But the court agreed in January to hear Italy's appeal. It awarded her 5,000 euros ($7,400) in damages in November. Seventeen judges heard the appeal Wednesday.
