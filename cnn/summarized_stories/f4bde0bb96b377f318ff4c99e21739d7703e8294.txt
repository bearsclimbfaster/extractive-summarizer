The stadium at the heart of the 2012 London Olympics is set to be transformed into a football ground once the Games have finished, after English Premier League side West Ham were named as the preferred future residents of the venue on Friday. The 80,000 capacity stadium will replace nearby Upton Park as West Ham's home but will retain its capability to host athletics events thanks to a commitment from the east London club to keep the running track in place. The decision ends a period of jostling between West Ham and -- Premier League and London rivals -- Tottenham Hotspur, who were also hoping to relocate to the arena after the Olympics. Spurs proposed rebuilding a 60,000-seater, football-only venue on the same site but the plan failed to convince the Olympic Park Legacy Company (OPLC) who decide on the future use of the location.
