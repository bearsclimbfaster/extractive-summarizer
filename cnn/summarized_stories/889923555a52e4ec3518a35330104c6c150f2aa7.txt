Outside the jail where he is staying, though he isn't a prisoner, Indian activist Anna Hazare has a growing crowd of supporters to back him up. We will not move from here," said Tarun Garg, one of Hazare's supporters, on Wednesday. Hazare was planning to go on a hunger strike to call for stronger anti-corruption measures when he was detained Tuesday. Now it looks like the anti-corruption crusader has accepted a police proposal that will allow him to fast in New Delhi for two weeks. Hazare adviser Kiran Bedi said on Twitter that police removed "unacceptable conditions" and will allow the protest to begin Thursday afternoon. The prime minister's handling of the protest appears to have added to Hazare's status, because it makes it look like the government is going after the messenger rather than offering solutions. In April, Suresh Kalmadi, the chief organizer for last year's Commonwealth Games, was arrested and accused of buying a time, scoring and result system from a Swiss company at inflated costs. Meanwhile, India's former telecom minister A. Raja, several bureaucrats and corporate officials are facing trial in connection with a multi-billion-dollar scandal involving the suspected below-price sale of mobile-phone radio waves or spectrum in 2008. Many had "I am Anna" labels on their shirts.
