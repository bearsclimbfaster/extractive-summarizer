Now they're a reminder of the layered security landscape that has evolved at airports since the September 11, 2001, attacks. As the 10-year anniversary of that day approaches, CNN asked security experts to weigh in on changes in aviation security in the United States since 9/11 and to offer a glimpse of what's likely to happen next. The good news for the widely criticized Transportation Security Administration? "The TSA is exhibiting much more open-mindedness and has already accepted the concept that there is a need to look at people as well as what they carry," said Rafi Ron, president of Virginia-based New Age Security Solutions and former head of security of Ben-Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv, Israel. "The past 10 years were mostly wasted by consistently holding to the idea that we can solve the problem by technological screening only," Ron said. Body scanners, metal detectors and pat-downs have limitations and responding to recent threats by having passengers remove shoes or carry only small amounts of liquid doesn't make sense, analysts say. "Try to anticipate the future, rather than reacting to the past," said Richard Bloom, director of terrorism, espionage and security studies at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. Pistole, a former deputy director for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, has said intelligence is the best tool for preventing terrorism, and the agency is testing measures at airports that it hopes will make things easier for most travelers. The program is expected to launch in October. "The P word"

The path to a more effective and efficient, intelligence-driven system is not easy. Everyone profiles, consciously or unconsciously, Bloom said.
