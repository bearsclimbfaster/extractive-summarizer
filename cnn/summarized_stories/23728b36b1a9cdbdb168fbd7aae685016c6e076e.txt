The arrest of a Connecticut town's finance director -- who is accused of embezzling $2.3 million while financially supporting his mistress in Florida -- has left the small community in financial crisis. Henry L. Centrella Jr., 59, was arrested in August on five counts of first-degree larceny after several months of investigation found more than $2 million of misappropriated funds from January 2008 through November 2012, according to his arrest warrant. Centrella had served as the finance director for the town of Winchester since 1982 and had unrestricted access to the town's assets and finances for more than 30 years. He was fired in January, the warrant said. According to sworn statements written by members of his staff, Centrella never allowed anyone to assist him with depositing the town's money in the bank, even if he was on vacation, insisting that money be kept in a drawer for him until his return. Centrella paid for all of these expenses in cash.
