Asked about part of the entertainment business he particularly enjoys, Greg Behrendt -- stand-up comedian, author, TV writer and producer -- had an unusual answer. Greg Behrendt co-wrote "He's Just Not That Into You," based on a popular episode of "Sex and the City." "My instrumental punk and ska band called the Reigning Monarchs," he said with a laugh. ... We play shows around Los Angeles." But the co-author of "He's Just Not That Into You," now a film starring Jennifer Aniston, Scarlett Johansson and Ben Affleck, admits that stand-up comedy remains a longtime passion.
