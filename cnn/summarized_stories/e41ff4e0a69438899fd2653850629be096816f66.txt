A 36-inch underground natural gas pipeline exploded into flames Monday in Johnson County, Texas, killing one and injuring at least five people before officials were able to shut the flow of gas, officials said. Cleburne Fire Chief Clint Ishmael said all 13 workers on the crew at the site when the blast took place were accounted for and that one was dead. "There was a crew working on the line, and they apparently ruptured it somehow and caused an explosion," Cleburne City Manager Chester Nolen said.
