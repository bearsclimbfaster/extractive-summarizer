Zahra Baker had been an international symbol of strength and hope: A freckle-faced girl who lost part of her left leg at age 5 and her hearing while being treated for cancer, she kept smiling and fighting through it all. Yet Zahra's life ended violently in fall 2010. "Zahra and her life will be forever in our thoughts, and 'Team Zahra' will forever be connected through her spirit." Some of her other remains were found November 11 of that year.
