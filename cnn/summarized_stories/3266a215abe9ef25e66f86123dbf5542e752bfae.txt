The City of Brotherly Love is cracking down after a rash of teen violence by roving mobs. Late Friday, there were no signs of trouble, police spokesman Ray Evers told CNN. "It definitely made a tremendous difference," he said, referring to the curfew. Police patrolled the two areas under curfew, including downtown areas popular with locals and tourists during the Friday night curfew. All 50 were picked up by Saturday morning, Evers said.
