It was the annual gathering of the geeks in the city that never sleeps. After an attendance of 116,000 in 2012, New York Comic Con tickets were sold out this year, as crowds lined up to attend panels, meet their favorite sci-fi/fantasy celebrities and comic book creators and show off their latest cosplay (or costume play) creations. The convention ceased that particular Twitter practice on Friday.
