In Madrid, all the talk is about "La Decima". In London, all the talk was about the "Special One". Tonight, after a performance which helped to write another chapter in one of the season's most romantic fairy tales, Atletico Madrid allowed itself to dream of its own special one -- La Primera -- the first. Atletico, for so long a club living in the shadow of city rival Real, has the opportunity to make history not just at home but also on the European stage. A convincing 3-1 win over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge secured a place in the Champions League final and allowed the dream of a league and European double to prosper. This Atletico team has guts, resilience and an indefatigable spirit -- but what it also has, in abundance, is quality. Trailing to Fernando Torres' strike, Atletico offered a brutal riposte with Adrian Lopez leveling before Diego Costa and Arda Turan applied the finishing touches. Four points clear at the top of La Liga with three games remaining and a clash with Real to decide the destiny of the Champions League trophy to come in Lisbon on May 24, this is turning out to be some season for Atletico. But we knew Chelsea had to play more. After our goal Chelsea went down a bit, but we were confident and now we are there. Last year we won the Cup in their stadium so we are confident."
